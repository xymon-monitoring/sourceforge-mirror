.TH HOBBIT-STATUSREPORT.CGI 1 "Version 4.2-RC-20060711: 10 Jul 2006" "Hobbit Monitor"
.SH NAME
hobbit-statusreport.cgi \- CGI program to report a status for a group of servers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "hobbit-statusreport.cgi --column=COLUMNNAME [options]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhobbit-statusreport.cgi\fR is a CGI tool to generate a simple HTML
report showing the current status of a single column for a group of
Hobbit hosts.

E.g. You can use this report to get an overview of all of the SSL 
certificates that are about to expire.

The generated webpage is a simple HTML table, suitable for copying
into other documents or e-mail.

hobbit-statusreport.cgi runs as a CGI program, invoked by your webserver.
It is normally run via a wrapper shell-script in the CGI directory for Hobbit.

.SH EXAMPLES
The Hobbit installation includes two web report scripts using this
CGI tool: The \fBhobbit-certreport.sh\fR script generates a list of
SSL server certificates that are yellow or red (i.e. they will expire
soon); and the \fBhobbit-nongreen.sh\fR script generates a report
of all statuses that are currently non-green. These can be accessed
from a web browser through a URL referencing the script in the
Hobbit CGI directory (e.g. "/hobbit-cgi/hobbit-nongreen.sh").

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--column=COLUMNNAME"
Report the status of the COLUMNNAME column.

.IP "--all"
Report the status for all hosts known to Hobbit. By default,
this tool reports only on the hosts found on the current page
from where the CGI was invoked (by looking at the "pagepath"
cookie).

.IP "--filter=CRITERIA"
Only report on statuses that match the CRITERIA setting. See the
.I bb(1)
man-page - in the "hobbitdboard" command description - for 
details about specifying filters.

.IP "--heading=HTML"
Defines the webpage heading - i.e. the "title" tag in the generated
HTML code.

.IP "--show-column"
Include the column name in the display.

.IP "--show-colors"
Show the status color on the generated webpage. The default is 
to not show the status color.

.IP "--no-colors"
Do not include text showing the current color of each status in
the report. This is the default.

.IP "--show-summary"
Show only a summary of the important lines in the status message.
By default, the entire status message appears in the generated 
HTML code. This option causes the first non-blank line of the status
message to be shown, and also any lines beginning with "&COLOR" which
is used by many status messages to point out lines of interest 
(non-green lines only, though).

.IP "--show-message"
Show the entire message on the webpage. This is the default.

.IP "--link"
Include HTML links to the host "info" page, and the status page.

.IP "--embedded"
Only generate the HTML table, not a full webpage. This can be used
to embed the status report into an external webpage.

.IP "--env=FILENAME"
Load the environment from FILENAME before executing the CGI.

.IP "--area=NAME"
Load environment variables for a specific area. NB: if used,
this option must appear before any --env=FILENAME option.
