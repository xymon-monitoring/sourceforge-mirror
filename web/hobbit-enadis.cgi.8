.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhobbit-enadis.cgi\fR is a CGI tool for disabling and enabling
hosts and tests monitored by Hobbit. You can disable monitoring of
a single test, all tests for a host, or multiple hosts - immediately
or at a future point in time.

hobbit-enadis.cgi runs as a CGI program, invoked by your webserver.
It is normally run via a wrapper shell-script in the secured CGI 
directory for Hobbit.

hobbit-enadis.cgi is the back-end script for the enable/disable
form present on the "info" status-pages. It can also run in
"stand-alone" mode, in which case it displays a web form allowing
users to select what to enable or disable.
