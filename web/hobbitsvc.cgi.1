.TH BB-HOSTSVC.CGI 1 "Version 3.2:  4 okt 2004" "bbgen toolkit"
.SH NAME
bb-hostsvc.cgi \- Big Brother CGI program to view status logs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bb-hostsvc.cgi [--bbgend|--historical] [--history={top|bottom}]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I bb-hostsvc.cgi
is a CGI program to present a Big Brother status log in HTML 
form (ie, as a web page). It can be used both for the logs
showing the current status, and for historical logs from the
Big Brother "histlogs" directory. It is normally invoked as a
CGI program, and therefore receives most of the input parameters
via the CGI QUERY_STRING environment variable.

Unless the "--historical" option is present, the current status log
is used. This assumes a QUERY_STRING environment variable of the form
.br
   HOSTSVC=hostname.servicename
.br
where "hostname" is the name of the host with commas instead of dots,
and "servicename" is the name of the service (the column name in Big
Brother). Such links are automatically generated by the
.I bbgen(1)
tool when "BBLOGSTATUS=dynamic" is set in the Big Brother configuration.

With the "--historical" option present, a historical logfile is
used. This assumes a QUERY_STRING environment variable of the form
.br
   HOST=hostname&SERVICE=servicename&TIMEBUF=timestamp
.br
where "hostname" is the name of the host with commas instead of dots,
"servicename" is the name of the service, and "timestamp" is the time
of the log. This is automatically generated by the
.I bb-hist.cgi(1)
tool.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--bbgend"
Retrieve the current status log from
.I bbgend(1)
rather than from the logfile. This is for use with the
.I bbgend(1)
replacement daemon from the bbgen toolkit version 4.

.IP "--historical"
Use a historical logfile instead of the current logfile.

.IP "--history={top|bottom|none}"
When showing the current logfile, provide a "HISTORY" button
at the top or the bottom of the webpage, or not at all. The default 
is to put the HISTORY button at the bottom of the page.
