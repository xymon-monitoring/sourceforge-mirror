README file for Hobbit
======================

What is it ?
------------
Hobbit is a system for monitoring your network servers and 
applications. It is heavily inspired by the Big Brother
tool, but is a complete re-implementation with a lot of added
functionality and performance improvements. A slightly more
detailed rationale for Hobbit is in the docs/about.html file.


How to install
--------------
Detailed installation instructions are in the 
docs/install.html file. Essentially, it boils down
to running
	./configure
	make
	make install
but do have a look at the install.html file for more
detailed instructions.


Documentation
-------------
The docs/ directory holds information about the basic
installation and configuration of Hobbit. All of the
tools and configuration files in Hobbit have man-pages
that are installed automatically when installing Hobbit.
The hobbit(7) man page provides an introduction to 
Hobbit and has pointers to the other man-pages of the
package.
