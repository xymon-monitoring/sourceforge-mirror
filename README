README file for bbgen toolkit
=============================

What is it ?
------------
The bbgen toolkit provides drop-in replacements for key components
of the Big Brother monitoring package:

- bbgen is a replacement for the mkbb.sh and other web page 
  shellscripts;
- bbtest-net is a replacement for the bb-network.sh network
  test script;
- other tools replace other less frequently used scripts from
  the Big Brother package.

The bbgen replacement tools are much faster than the scripts
they replace, resulting in better performance and less load
on the Big Brother BBDISPLAY and BBNET servers.

Besides being simple replacements, these tools also implement
a large number of features not present in the standard Big 
Brother package. These features are aimed at providing the
features needed to use Big Brother and bbgen for monitoring
of a large number of systems on a 24x7 basis, with reporting
facilities for Service Level Agreements etc.

The bbgen toolkit is fully compatible with Big Brother
version 1.9c and the commonly used add-on package LARRD
version 0.42 and 0.43.

A more detailed description of the bbgen features can be
found in the bbgen-intro.html file, which is a HTML version
of the bbgen-intro(7) man page.


How to install
--------------
Detailed installation instructions are in the INSTALL file.
If you are upgrading from a previous release of bbgen, refer
to the UPGRADE file for changes you should be aware of.


Documentation
-------------
As of version 2.6, all documentation for the bbgen tools
are in the form of Unix man-pages included with the bbgen
package. These man-pages are installed automatically when
installing bbgen, and should be available on-line. The
bbgen-intro(7) man page provides an introduction to the
toolkit and has pointers to the other man-pages of the
package.
