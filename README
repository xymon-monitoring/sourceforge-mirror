README file for bbgen and friends version 2.0
=============================================

bbgen is a drop-in replacement for the bb-display.sh script that 
ships with the Big Brother monitoring tool.  It can also replace 
part of the LARRD tool that is often used with Big Brother. See
the INSTALL.bbgen for details

bbtest-web and bbtest-net are utilities that can replace the 
bb-network.sh network test utility in Big Brother. See 
INSTALL.bbtest for details.

bbgen, bbtest-web, bbtest-net and bbgmchosts and sources are

Features
--------

The main feature of these tools is speed. My BB installation currently
has about 350 hosts, spread over 50 pages and subpages. The time
to generate the pages with bb-display.sh was about 12 minutes;
bbgen does it in less than 5 seconds.

The network test tools (bbtest-net, bbtest-web) also give 
significant speed improvements for large sites. One site 
reported that the runtime for their network tests dropped
from 1000 seconds to about 30.

bbgen also supports the generation of files for the LARRD
graphics plugin for Big Brother (http://www.packetpushers.com/larrd).
LARRD uses a Perl script to generate stub HTML pages on the
Big Brother display - bbgen can generate these pages, so you 
do not need to run the larrd-html.pl script. This gives the
other LARRD scripts more time to handle the import of data
for your trend graphs, instead of wasting it with generation
of the web pages. See the "LARRD support" section in INSTALL.bbgen.

There are a couple of non-standard tags in bb-hosts that the
tools will recognize. See the "README.bbhosts" file for a 
detailed description of these.


Requirements
------------

A working Big Brother installation. Get BB up and running first,
then you can drop in bbgen and bbtest-web/bbtest-net to speed
things up.

For testing websites, the "curl" utility must be installed. 
This tool is available from http://curl.haxx.se/.

For network connectivity tests, the "fping.sh" script must
be installed. This is available from the Big Brother archive
on http://www.deadcat.net/


Compatibility
-------------

bbgen is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the bb-display.sh
script in Big Brother version 1.9c. The pages generated by bbgen should 
be similar to what you get with bb-display.sh from BB version 1.9c.

If you enable bbgen's LARRD support, you will need to change a few
of the Big Brother files - see "LARRD support" below. The LARRD
support has been tested with LARRD 0.42; the newer versions that 
have started appearing now (March-April 2003) have not been tested.
LARRD 0.43 claims to be backwards compatible.

The only known difference is that pages with both hosts and subpages
have the hosts first in standard Big Brother; bbgen by default places 
the hosts last (after the subpages). If you want the standard BB
behaviour, run bbgen with the "--pages-last" option.

The following features in bb-display.sh are not currently implemented
in bbgen:

* "group" directives in bb-hosts are handled as "group-compress".
  I currently have no plans to support the simple "group"
  directive.

* Modem banks are not handled at all by bbgen. This directive
  is simply ignored - if you have a pressing need for bbgen
  to support it, let me know.


bbtest-net and bbtest-web are drop-in replacements for the
standard bb-network.sh script, with the following exceptions:

* ping checks (the "conn" column) are not handled by bbtest-net.
  You are advised to install the fping.sh script from www.deadcat.net
  to take care of the connectivity tests.

* The ":q" and ":Q" options on individual tests are ignored.

* Dialup-service and modem bank testing is not supported.
  Note: This only applies to the entries in bb-hosts that
  *begin* with the "dialup" keyword, and is used to test
  a range of IP-adresses. The "dialup" flag on a host is
  implemented, as is the "?" on a network test that flags
  it as a "dialup" service.


Installation
------------

See the INSTALL.bbgen file for information on how to install bbgen.

See the INSTALL.bbtest file for information on how to use
bbtest-web and bbtest-net.


Planned improvements
--------------------

See the "TODO" file. However, I am open to suggestions if you
have a feature you would like to see added.
