<h1>About Hobbit</h1>

<h3>What is Hobbit ?</h3>

<p>Hobbit is a tool for monitoring servers, applications and networks.
It collects information about the health of your computers, the
applications running on them, and the network connectivity between
them. All of this information is presented in a set of simple, 
intuitive webpages that are updated frequently to reflect changes
in the status of your systems.</p>

<p>Hobbit is capable of monitoring a vast set of network services,
e.g. mail-servers, web-servers (both plain HTTP and encrypted
HTTPS), local server application logs, ressource utilisation 
and much more.</p>

<p>Much of the information is processed and stored in RRD files,
which then form the basis for providing trend graphs showing
how e.g. webserver response-times vary over time.</p>


<h3>This sounds a lot like Big Brother!</h3>

<p>Hobbit started out as a replacement for a small part of Big 
Brother, and owes a great deal of inspiration to how Big Brother
works. In fact, Hobbit does not currently have any client-side
implementation - it relies on Big Brother clients for monitoring
of local server performance and health status.</p>


<h3>So why Hobbit ?</h3>

<p>There were a number of reasons why I decided to develop something
to replace Big Brother.</p>

<ul>
<li>Big Brother cannot monitor large networks.<br>
<p>BB is implemented mostly as shell-scripts, and performance suffers
greatly from this. In large networks where you need to monitor
hundreds or thousands of hosts, processing of the data simply
cannot keep up.</p></li>

<li>Setting up a full-featured BB server is complicated.<br>
<p>Big Brother has a huge number of add-ons, available from the
<a href="http://www.deadcat.net/">www.deadcat.net</a> site. This
is both a blessing and a curse - you can find anything you need
as an add-on, but many of the add-ons really ought to have been
part of the base package.<br>
E.g. the ability to track historical performance data was essential
to my use of BB, but this relies on the LARRD add-on which is not
fully integrated into BB. Other "must-have" features - e.g. the
ability to check SSL-enabled services and SSL certificates - 
required more add-ons to the standard BB.<br>
Maintaining and improving all of these add-ons as new versions 
were released was getting complex.</p></li>

<li>Big Brother is a commercial package - it is not Open Source.<br>
<p>Although the BB "Better-than-Free" license permits the use of
BB for non-commercial use without having to buy a license, it
is still a non-free package in the Open Source sense. I fully
respect the decision of the people behind Big Brother to choose
the licensing terms they find best - just as I can choose the
licensing terms that I find best for the software I develop.
It is my sincere belief that an Open Source license works best
for a project such as Hobbit, where community involvement is
essential to get a tool capable of monitoring as many different
systems as possible.</p>
<p>An interesting <a href="http://www.moonviewscientific.com/essays/software_lifecycle.htm">essay</a> appeared recently, which tries to explain
why Open Source is the natural way for a software product to
evolve. If you are curious as to why the trend seems to be that
more and more software exist in an Open Source version, I suggest
you have a look at it.</p></li>

<li>Development of Big Brother appears to have stopped.<br>
<p>At least for the non-commercial (BTF) version, there hasn't
been any real changes for more than a year.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So in the end, writing something new turned out to be the
most reasonable way of getting the system I need. And besides,
it's a lot of fun.</p>

<h3>Didn't you write something called &quot;bbgen&quot; ?</h3>
<p>Yes I did. The <b>bbgen toolkit</b> was the name I used for
this collection of tools from 2002 until the end of 2004 (i.e.
bbgen version 1.x, 2.x and 3.x). With the release of version 4,
bbgen has evolved into a complete replacement for the server-side
of Big Brother, and I decided to change the name to avoid any
misunderstanding about whether this was an add-on to Big Brother,
or a replacement for it. Since Hobbit provides all of the functionality
needed for a systems- and network-monitoring tool, I felt the time
was right for moving away from the Big Brother relation that was
present in the &quot;bbgen&quot; name.</p>

<p>All of the tools from bbgen are included in Hobbit. So you
may continue to use these together with your Big Brother/bbgen
installation.</p>

<h3>Why did you call it Hobbit ?</h3>
<p>Choosing a name is <em>hard</em>. I wanted a name that was easy
to remember; could be interpreted as a somewhat meaningful acronym;
and one that did not refer directly to the Big Brother origin.<br>
&quot;Hobbit&quot; could mean &quot;High-performance Open-source BB ImplemenTation&quot;
but it might as well just be a name. If you're familiar with the
Hobbit's in Tolkien's books, you will know that hobbits are very fond of
things that are green - just like any systems- or network-administrator 
prefers his monitoring screen to be. They also pay a great deal of 
attention to what is happening around them, and are capable of doing
things that you would not think they could when you first saw them.
All of these characteristics apply well to the Hobbit monitor.

<h3>My Big Brother setup works just fine. Should I use Hobbit ?</h3>
<p>It is your choice. I think Hobbit has many improvements over BB,
so I would of course say 'Yes, I think you should'. But in the end 
it is You who have to deal with the hassle of setting up and learning
a new system, so if you are comfortable with what Big Brother is
doing for you now, I am not forcing you to switch.</p>

<h3>Who are you, and why do you think you can do a better BB than BB ?</h3>
<p>My name is Henrik Storner. I was born in 1964, and live in 
Copenhagen, Denmark. I have a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the Univ.
of Copenhagen, and have been working with computers and Unix systems
for more than 20 years. I have been developing bits and pieces of Open 
Source software for the past 10 years - you'll find my name in the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/CREDITS">Linux kernel CREDITS file</a> - 
and I am actively involved in the local Linux Users Group 
<a href="http://www.sslug.dk/">SSLUG</a>, one of the largest LUG's world-wide, 
where I am a systems administrator for their Internet servers (web, e-mail, news).</p>
<p>I started using Big Brother around 1998, for monitoring a bunch of
servers that I was administering. In late 2001 I began working for
the CSC Managed Web Services division in Copenhagen, and one of my
first tasks was to improve on the monitoring and SLA reporting. After
looking at what the standard tools could do, I decided to setup a
Big Brother system as a demonstration of what could be done. This was
an immediate success. Systems were rapidly added to the Big Brother
monitor, and I began to see some of the scalability problems that 
happen when you go from monitoring 50 servers to monitoring 500.
So I decided it was time to do something about it, and during the
autumn and early winter 2002 bbgen was born. The rest is history.</p>
