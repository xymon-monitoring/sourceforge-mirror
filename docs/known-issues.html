<h3><a name="bugreport">How to report bugs</a></h3>
<p>If you think you have found a bug in Hobbit, please report it
to the Hobbit mailing list at <a href="mailto:hobbit@hswn.dk">hobbit@hswn.dk</a>.
You can do a lot to help getting bugs fixed by providing detailed information
about the bug:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Always include the version number of Hobbit you're using</li>
	<li>If one of the Hobbit tools crashes and leaves a core-file (usually
	in the ~hobbit/server/tmp/ directory), please use the <b>gdb</b> tool to
	pinpoint where the crash occurred:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Login as the Hobbit user</li>
		<li><tt>
			$ <b>cd ~/server</b><br>
			$ <b>gdb bin/PROGRAMFILE tmp/COREFILE</b><br>
		</tt>then at the <tt>gdb&gt;</tt> prompt, execute the command<br>
		<tt>
			gdb&gt; <b>bt</b>
		</tt></li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3><a name="jsval">Internet Explorer complains about Javascript errors in Enable/Disable</a></h3>
<p>This happens for some, but works for most people. One workaround
is to disable the Javascript validation code in the enable/disable
function: Edit ~hobbit/cgi-bin/hobbit-enadis.sh script and add the 
option "--no-jsvalidation" to the hobbisvc.cgi command - this disables
Javascript validation on the "info" page - and edit the file 
~hobbit/server/web/maint_form so you remove the text 'onClick="validateDisable(this.form)"'
from the input-tag near the end of that file.</p>

<h3><a name="dnserror">DNS error reported for network tests</a></h3>
<p>The bbtest-net network tester uses the built-in ARES library for
DNS lookups. There have been reports that this library fails on
some systems; one confirmed case is on "OSF1 V5.1". So if you 
suddenly get a lot of failed network tests that report "DNS error",
try running bbtest-net with the "--no-ares" option to use the
standard DNS lookups instead.</p>

<h3><a name="netfail">Network tests fail sporadically, or report long reponsetimes</a></h3>
<p>The bbtest-net network tester runs many tests in parallel; by default
it will typically run up to 256 tests concurrently. This may be more
than your network test server or network infrastructure can handle; if
you see sporadic timeouts of network tests or the graphs show increased
responsetimes, you can lower the number of concurrent tests by adding
the "--concurrency=N" option to bbtest-net in the <tt>~/server/etc/hobbittasks.cfg</tt>
file (for Hobbit), or the <tt>$BBHOME/bin/bb-network.sh</tt> file (Big Brother).
This has been especially important for sites doing many
http checks, since these typically have much more traffic going on
while testing than simple TCP services such as smtp.</p>

<h3><a name="solarisrandom">Network tests fail on Solaris with "Failed to find enough entropy"</a></h3>
<p>OpenSSL uses random data to initialise a key that is negotiated when
a new SSL-encrypted connection is being setup. Solaris 8 and earlier
doesn't have a standard way of getting random data, so OpenSSL cannot
get all of the randomness it needs. Solaris <b>patch 112438</b> solves this
by adding a /dev/random device that provides random data to applications.<br>
Thanks to Scott Kelley for the pointer to the Solaris patch.</p>
