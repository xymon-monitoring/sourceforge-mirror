<h3><a name="noclient">My client-side tests dont show up on the webpages</a></h3>
<p>Did you install a client ? It is not included with Hobbit, so you
need to install the Big Brother client for client side tests.</p>

<p>If you prefer an open-source client package, there is a Hobbit
client available on hobbitmon.sourceforge.net. It is currently only
for NetBSD systems, but work is underway to port it to other Unix
systems - including Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris.</p>

<p>If you did install a client, then the two most probable causes for 
this are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The client is using another hostname than what is in the bb-hosts file.<br>
	Hobbit only cares about the hosts that are in the bb-hosts file, and
	discards status-reports from unknown hosts. If you check the "hobbitd"
	column on the webserver display for the Hobbit server, you will see 
	a report about these unknown hosts.<br>
	Either reconfigure the client to use the same hostname as is in the
	bb-hosts file, or add a <tt>CLIENT:clienthostname</tt> tag in the
	bb-hosts file so Hobbit knows what host matches the client hostname.</li>

	<li>A firewall is blocking the client access to the Hobbit server.<br>
	Clients must be able to connect to the Hobbit server on TCP port 1984
	to send their status reports. If this port is blocked by a firewall,
	client status reports will not show up.<br>
	If possible, open up the firewall to allow this access. Alternatively,
	you may setup a proxy using the <em>bbproxy</em> tool (part of Hobbit)
	to forward status messages from a protected network to the Hobbit
	server.<br>
	Other methods are also possible, e.g. <em>bbfetch</em> (available from
	the <a href="http://www.deadcat.net/">www.deadcat.net</a> archive.
</ul>

<p>Add a <tt>CLIENT:clienthostname</tt> tag to the host entry in the bb-hosts file,
or re-configure the client to use the proper hostname.</p>

<p>They have been integrated into the Hobbit network daemon. See

<h3><a name="apachetest">Getting the Apache performance graphs</a></h3>
<p>Charles Jones provided this recipe on the Hobbit mailing list:</p>

Subject: Re: [hobbit] Apache tag

Okay, first you must make the indicated addition to your apache
httpd.conf (or you can make a hobbit.conf in apaches conf.d directory).
[ed: See the bb-hosts man-page for the "apache" description]

Then, you must restart apache for the change to take effect
(/etc/init.d/httpd restart).

Then, manually test the server-stats url to make sure it's working, by
using your browser and going to
http://your.server.com/server-status?auto  (you can also go to
http://your.server.com/server-status/ to get some nice extended apache
performance info).  You should get back something like this:

Total Accesses: 131577
Total kBytes: 796036
CPULoad: 1.0401
Uptime: 21595
ReqPerSec: 6.09294
BytesPerSec: 37746.7
BytesPerReq: 6195.16
BusyWorkers: 43
IdleWorkers: 13

Scoreboard: RR__RWR___RR_R_RR_RRRRRRRRR_RRRRRRR__RRR_RRRRCRRRRR_RRRR........................................................................................................................................................................................................

Now, assuming you are getting back the server-status info, time to make
sure your bb-hosts is correctly configured to collect and graph the
data.  Heres what I have in mine:

1.2.3.4    my.server.com  # conn ssh http://1.2.3.4 apache=http://1.2.3.4/server-status?auto LARRD:*,apache:apache|apache1|apache2|apache3

 From what you said of your setup, I'm guessing your only problem is
 using the wrong url for the apache tag (you used
 "apache=http://192.168.1.25/hobbit/" which just won't work - that's the
 kind of URL you would use for the http tag).

 Hope this helped.

<h3><a name="updatefreq">I need the web-pages to update more frequently</a></h3>
<p>The ~/server/etc/hobbitlaunch.cfg defines the update
interval for all of the Hobbit programs. The default is for
network tests to run every 5 minutes, and webpage updates to
happen once a minute.</p>
<p>Note that if you run the <em>bbretest-net.sh</em> tool
on your network test server (this is the default for a new
Hobbit server), then network tests that fail 
will run every minute for up to 30 minutes after the initial
failure, so usually there is little need to change the update
interval for your network tests.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="fahrenheit">I want my temperature graphs in Fahrenheit</a></h3>
<p>Edit the file server/etc/hobbitgraph.cfg, and change the <b>[temperature]</b>
definition from the default one to the one below that shows Fahrenheit graphs.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="nohtmllink">How do I remove the HTML links from the alert messages?</a></h3>
<p>Configure your alerts in server/etc/hobbit-alerts.cfg to use <tt>FORMAT=PLAIN</tt>
instead of TEXT.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="mancgi">I cannot see the the man-pages on the web</a></h3>
<p>A common Apache configuration mistakenly believes any filename containing
".cgi" is a CGI-script, so it refuses to present the man-pages for the CGI
scripts. Stephen Beaudry found the solution:</p>
<pre>
   This occurs because by default, apache associates the cgi-script
   handler with any filename containing ".cgi".  I fixed this on my server
   by changing the following line in my httpd.conf

   AddHandler cgi-script .cgi     -&gt;to-&gt;    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi$
</pre>

<hr>
<h3><a name="maintpl">Enable/Disable does not work</a></h3>
<p>If you see this error message in your webserver log:</p>
<p><tt>Insecure directory in $ENV{PATH} while running with -T</tt></p>
<p>then your webserver is running CGI scripts such as maint.pl without
setting up a proper PATH for them. Perl complains about this.</p>
<p>The solution is to setup your webserver so it provides a sane PATH
setting to CGI scripts. A bit of digging on <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_env.html#setenv">httpd.apache.org</a> reveals 
that adding</p>
<code> SetEnv PATH /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin</code>
<p>is the way to set environment variables for CGI scripts.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="mailnosubj">My alert emails come without a subject</a></h3>
<p>Hobbit by default uses the system <b>mail</b> command to send out messages.
Solaris mail-command does not understand the "-s SUBJECT" syntax that Hobbit uses.
So you get mails with no subject. The solution is to change the MAIL setting in
etc/hobbitserver.cfg to use the <b>mailx</b> command instead. Hobbit needs to be
restarted after this change./p>
