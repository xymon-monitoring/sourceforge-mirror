<h1>Using Hobbit</h1>

<p>Here you will find out how to do some of the more common things
with Hobbit.</p>

<h3>Renaming and deleting rows (hosts) and columns (tests)</h3>

<h4>Where are the bbrm and bbmv commands from Big Brother ?</h4>
<p>They have been integrated into the Hobbit network daemon. See
the next two questions.</p>


<h4>I accidentally added an 'ftp' check. Now I cannot get it off the webpage!</h4>
<p>Use the command
<pre>
    ~/server/bin/bb 127.0.0.1 "drop HOSTNAME ftp"
</pre>
to permanenly remove all traces of a test. Note that you need the quotes
around the &quot;hobbitddrop HOSTNAME ftp&quot;.</p>


<h4>So how do I get rid of an entire host in Hobbit?</h4>
<p>First, remove the host from the ~/server/etc/bb-hosts file. Then use the command
<pre>
    ~/server/bin/bb 127.0.0.1 "drop HOSTNAME"
</pre>
to permanenly remove all traces of a host. Note that you need the quotes
around the &quot;hobbitddrop HOSTNAME&quot;.</p>


<h4>How do I rename a host in the Hobbit display?</h4>
<p>First, change the ~/server/etc/bb-hosts file so it has the new name.
Then to move your historical data over to the new name, run
<pre>
    ~/server/bin/bb 127.0.0.1 "rename OLDHOSTNAME NEWHOSTNAME"
</pre></p>


<h3>Tweaking the configuration</h3>
<h4>I need the web-pages to update more frequently</h4>
<p>The ~/server/etc/hobbitlaunch.cfg defines the update
interval for all of the Hobbit programs. The default is for
network tests to run every 5 minutes, and webpage updates to
happen once a minute.</p>
<p>Note that if you run the <em>bbretest-net.sh</em> tool
on your network test server (this is the default for a new
Hobbit server), then network tests that fail 
will run every minute for up to 30 minutes after the initial
failure, so usually there is little need to change the update
interval for your network tests.</p>
