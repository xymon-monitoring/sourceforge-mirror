<h1>Hobbit Tips and Tricks</h1>

<p>Here you will find out how to do some of the more common things
with Hobbit. If you think of something else that should go here,
please send a note to henrik-bb@hswn.dk and I'll get it included in
a later version.</p>

<p>If you have a specific problem with something that is not working,
first check the <a href="known-issues.html">list of known issues</a>.
If you don't find the answer there, post a message to the Big Brother
mailing list at bb@bb4.com - I try to answer questions about Hobbit
in that forum.</p>


<h4>My client-side tests dont show up on the webpages</h4>
<p>The two most probable causes for this are:
<ul>
	<li>The client is using another hostname than what is in the bb-hosts file.<br>
	Hobbit only cares about the hosts that are in the bb-hosts file, and
	discards status-reports from unknown hosts. If you check the "hobbitd"
	column on the webserver display for the Hobbit server, you will see 
	a report about these unknown hosts.<br>
	Either reconfigure the client to use the same hostname as is in the
	bb-hosts file, or add a <tt>CLIENT:clienthostname</tt> tag in the
	bb-hosts file so Hobbit knows what host matches the client hostname.</li>

	<li>A firewall is blocking the client access to the Hobbit server.<br>
	Clients must be able to connect to the Hobbit server on TCP port 1984
	to send their status reports. If this port is blocked by a firewall,
	client status reports will not show up.<br>
	If possible, open up the firewall to allow this access. Alternatively,
	you may setup a proxy using the <em>bbproxy</em> tool (part of Hobbit)
	to forward status messages from a protected network to the Hobbit
	server.<br>
	Other methods are also possible, e.g. <em>bbfetch</em> (available from
	the <a href="http://www.deadcat.net/">www.deadcat.net</a> archive.
</ul>

<h4>My silly clients are using a hostname different from the one in bb-hosts</h4>
<p>Add a <tt>CLIENT:clienthostname</tt> tag to the host entry in the bb-hosts file,
or re-configure the client to use the proper hostname.</p>


<h4>Where are the bbrm and bbmv commands from Big Brother ?</h4>
<p>They have been integrated into the Hobbit network daemon. See
the next two questions.</p>


<h4>I accidentally added an 'ftp' check. Now I cannot get it off the webpage!</h4>
<p>Use the command
<pre>
    ~/server/bin/bb 127.0.0.1 "drop HOSTNAME ftp"
</pre>
to permanenly remove all traces of a test. Note that you need the quotes
around the &quot;drop HOSTNAME ftp&quot;.</p>


<h4>So how do I get rid of an entire host in Hobbit?</h4>
<p>First, remove the host from the ~/server/etc/bb-hosts file. Then use the command
<pre>
    ~/server/bin/bb 127.0.0.1 "drop HOSTNAME"
</pre>
to permanenly remove all traces of a host. Note that you need the quotes
around the &quot;drop HOSTNAME&quot;.</p>


<h4>How do I rename a host in the Hobbit display?</h4>
<p>First, change the ~/server/etc/bb-hosts file so it has the new name.
Then to move your historical data over to the new name, run
<pre>
    ~/server/bin/bb 127.0.0.1 "rename OLDHOSTNAME NEWHOSTNAME"
</pre></p>


<h4>I need the web-pages to update more frequently</h4>
<p>The ~/server/etc/hobbitlaunch.cfg defines the update
interval for all of the Hobbit programs. The default is for
network tests to run every 5 minutes, and webpage updates to
happen once a minute.</p>
<p>Note that if you run the <em>bbretest-net.sh</em> tool
on your network test server (this is the default for a new
Hobbit server), then network tests that fail 
will run every minute for up to 30 minutes after the initial
failure, so usually there is little need to change the update
interval for your network tests.</p>
