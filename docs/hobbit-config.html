<h1>Configuring Hobbit Monitoring</h1>
<p>The Hobbit configuration is kept in the files in the <tt>~/server/etc/</tt> 
directory. If you look at this directory, you will see these files:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="manpages/man5/bb-hosts.5.html">bb-hosts</a> is the one you will change the most. This file contains
	a list of all the hosts you are monitoring, including information such as their
	IP-address, what network services you are monitoring on the host, what URL's
	you are checking, what subpage in the Hobbit web-pages this host is shown on etc.
	The name of the file - "bb-hosts" - was chosen so it is compatible with the
	Big Brother system which uses the same filename and file format.</li>
	<li><a href="manpages/man5/hobbit-alerts.cfg.5.html">hobbit-alerts.cfg</a> holds the alerting configuration. In this file,
	you setup the rules for sending out alerts about services going down: Who gets
	the alert, how is it sent, how often, whether to send alerts 24x7 or only between
	10 AM and 4 PM on weekdays etc.</li>
	<li><a href="manpages/man5/hobbitserver.cfg.5.html">hobbitserver.cfg</a> is the configuration file for the Hobbit server.
	This file defines a lot of environment variables that are made available to
	all of the Hobbit programs when they run. Some environment variables that are defined
	in the Big Brother system are also setup by Hobbit, so that Big Brother extension
	scripts will work.<br>The initial configuration of hobbitserver.cfg is setup by the 
	<tt>configure</tt> script when you install Hobbit, and in most cases you will 
	not need to change it.</li>
	<li><a href="manpages/man5/hobbitlaunch.cfg.5.html">hobbitlaunch.cfg</a> is the configuration file for the <tt>hobbitlaunch</tt>
	tool. hobbitlaunch is the master program in Hobbit, it is the only program you start
	to run the Hobbit server. hobbitlaunch reads the hobbitlaunch.cfg file, and starts
	the programs listed here to run the server. Some of the programs may run as daemons,
	some of the programs may run at regular intervals. If you want to use some of the
	advanced options for the <tt>bbgen</tt> or <tt>bbtest-net</tt> programs, you change
	the hobbitlaunch.cfg file to add these options to the commandline.</li>
	<li><a href="manpages/man5/hobbitgraph.cfg.5.html">hobbitgraph.cfg</a> is a configuration file for the <tt>hobbitgraph CGI</tt>.
	It defines how the graphs are generated from the data in the RRD files.</li>
	<li><a href="manpages/man5/bb-services.5.html">bb-services</a> is a configuration file for the <tt>bbtest-net</tt> program.
	It defines how network services are checked.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Setting up monitoring of hosts</h1>
<p>The <a href="manpages/man5/bb-hosts.5.html">bb-hosts</a> file defines which hosts Hobbit monitors. When you install Hobbit,
a simple configuration is setup that just lists the Hobbit server:<br>
<img src="hobbit-bbhosts.png" alt="Simple Hobbit bb-hosts file"></p>

<p>There are a few things to notice here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Lines that begin with a <em>&#35;</em> are comments.</li>
	<li>Each host you monitor is on a line by itself, with the IP-address
	and the hostname of the host.</li>
	<li>You can add extra tags to each host definition, by putting in a
	&#35;-mark and then some keywords. These keywords define how Hobbit
	handles the host.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bb-hosts file shown in the example has only one host defined: 
<em>www.hswn.dk</em> which is the server running Hobbit. There are a few
extra keywords thrown in:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>BBDISPLAY, BBPAGER, BBNET</em> are compatibility settings 
	for extensions written for Big Brother. Hobbit doesn't use these,
	but puts them in the bb-hosts file to avoid problems if you mix 
	Hobbit and Big Brother modules.</li>
	<li><em>bbd</em> is the name of a <i>network test</i>. This keyword
	causes the Hobbit network-tester <tt>bbtest-net</tt> to check if 
	the bbd network service is running on this host, and send a status
	report to the Hobbit server with the information about this service.
	So you'll get a (hopefully!) green icon on the Hobbit webpage for
	this host, showing the status of the bbd network service.<br>
	Network services are defined in the <em>bb-services</em> file, so
	this file must have an entry for <tt>bbd</tt> defining what TCP
	port to check, and possibly also what data to send to the service and
	what to expect as a response.</li>
	<li><em>http://www.hswn.dk/</em> is a URL, obviously. This also
	triggers a network test, the Hobbit network tester will try to request
	this URL, and send in a status report showing if the URL was accessible
	or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, Hobbit will always check if the host is up and running by trying to
&quot;ping&quot; it. This results in a <em>conn</em> column on the Hobbit webpage
for this host, showing if the ping-test succeeded. If you have a host that does
not respond to ping - e.g. because there is a firewall that filters out such
requests - then you can disable the ping-test by putting a "noconn" keyword on 
the line in bb-hosts.</p>

<p>As you can see, the syntax is pretty straight-forward. Need to monitor an extra 
URL for this server ? Just add the URL to the line. Need to check if ssh (Secure Shell)
is running ? Just add <em>ssh</em> to the line. The full set of keywords you can
use is described in the <a href="manpages/man5/bb-hosts.5.html">bb-hosts man-page</a>.
Many of the keywords relate to the
way Hobbit displays the information about the host on the web-pages, other keywords
deal with how the uptime percentage is calculated for availability reports, and
some keywords - like the <em>bbd</em> and <em>http://...</em> mentioned above -
describe the network services that are tested for this host.</p>

<h3>Monitoring network services</h3>
<p>As shown in the example above, adding a network test for a host is as simple as
putting the right keyword into the bb-hosts file. The default set of network tests
configured in Hobbit 4.0 is as follows:</p>
<table align="center" width="80%" summary="Network test keywords">
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">conn</th><td>Simple ping test. Enabled by default, you can disable it by putting "noconn" into bb-hosts.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">http</th><td>Web-server test. Enter the URL to request from the webserver.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">ftp</th><td>FTP server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">ssh</th><td>SSH (Secure Shell) server test. Supports ssh1 and ssh2.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">telnet</th><td>Telnet server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">smtp</th><td>SMTP (Mail server) test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">pop3</th><td>POP-3 test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">imap</th><td>IMAP test. IMAP version 2 and 4 are supported, for version 3 use "imap3".</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">nntp</th><td>NNTP (News) server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">ldap</th><td>LDAP (Directory server) test. Enter the full LDAP URI if Hobbit is configured with LDAP support.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">rsync</th><td>rsync server test</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">bbd</th><td>Big Brother daemon test. Also works with the Hobbit network daemon.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">clamd</th><td>CLAM anti-virus daemon test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">oratns</th><td>Oracle TNS listener test. Will attempt to do an oratns "ping".</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">qmtp</th><td>QMTP server test. For qmail's qmtpd service.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">qmqp</th><td>QMQP server test. For qmail's qmqpd service.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If Hobbit is built with OpenSSL support, the following SSL-enabled services can also be checked:</p>
<table align="center" width="80%" summary="SSL network tests">
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">https</th><td>Web-server test. Enter the URL to request from the webserver.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">ftps</th><td>Secure FTP server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">telnets</th><td>Secure Telnet server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">smtps</th><td>Secure SMTP server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">pop3s</th><td>Secure POP-3 server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">imaps</th><td>Secure IMAP server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">nntps</th><td>Secure NNTP (News) server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">ldaps</th><td>Secure LDAP (Directory) server test. Enter the full LDAP URI if Hobbit is configured with LDAP support. Note that this is only possible when Hobbit is built with the OpenLDAP v2.x client library, and only for LDAP servers that support LDAP version 3 and the "starttls" command. LDAP server that use the older non-standard method of tunnelling LDAP through SSL on port 636 will not work.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>There are a few network tests that Hobbit can run for you, by using external programs. This is not a very effective way of testing, so it is only done this way for a few very specialised tests:</p>
<table align="center" width="80%" summary="Network tests using external programs">
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">ntp</th><td>NTP (Network Time protocol) server test, using the "ntpdate" command.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">rpc</th><td>RPC service test. This queries the <em>portmapper</em> service on the server, using the "rpcinfo" command. See the <b>bb-hosts(5)</b> man-page for details on how to test for specific RPC services.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Monitoring host-specific data with clients</h3>
<p>You can install an agent on each of the hosts you monitor, to check 
host-specific data such as CPU utilisation, disk usage, local logfiles, 
if certain processes and services are running etc. Hobbit does not 
include these agents, but since Big Brother and Hobbit are compatible,
you can use the Big Brother agents even though you are running Hobbit
on the server.</p>

<p>The Big Brother agents are available for download from the Big Brother
site <a href="http://bb4.org/">bb4.org</a>. Note that depending on what
the purpose is of your monitoring, you may have to buy a license to use
the client software, so check the Big Brother license terms.</p>
