Stuff that standard BB does which bbgen/bbtest-* does not
---------------------------------------------------------
* Convert the mkbwml.sh script to generate WAP pages
* Handle modem banks
* Handle "group" as mkbb.sh does
* Convert the acklog.sh extension for bb2.html. This does
  not load the system a great deal (at least for me), so
  doing it via the existing script as an extension is OK.
* Handle all fping.sh extensions (IP ranges, conn-failure
  root-cause analysis - i.e. traceroute + router dependency)
* Handle the bbnet "proxy" syntax: http://proxy/http://www.site.com/

Suggestions from users
----------------------
* Allow generation of the bb2.html / bbnk.html for 
  alternate pagesets, and have the eventlog&acklog show only
  events for the hosts that are part of this pageset.
  NB: This would require re-doing the acklog as part of
  bbgen, instead of via the current standard BB extension
  script.
* When a host exists on multiple pages, provide links to
  the other pages showing this host. Maybe from the "info"
  column view ?

If I have too much time someday
-------------------------------
* BB reporting sucks. But how should a good report
  feature be ?
* Re-implement bbd using ucspi-tcp "tcpserver" to
  catch incoming messages and store them to a file.
  Maybe restrict incoming messages to status/page only ?
  The disable/enable/notes messages could go via a unix 
  socket, so they could only be local.
  Then run a processing task to move messages off
  to the logs/ directory, generate web pages,
  initiate paging etc.
* Perhaps switch to using a DB for storing messages.
