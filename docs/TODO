* Copy existing .htaccess files when generating reports, instead
  of re-generating them from the env. variable templates. Useful
  when people setup their htaccess by hand and want them to be
  applied to reports as well.

Suggestions from users
----------------------
* Handle the missing fping.sh extensions ("range" and "list" tags).
  These are useful for hosts with multiple IP's, e.g. routers.

If I have too much time someday
-------------------------------
* Use Autoconf. Need to learn how to use it first, though.
* Communication between BBDISPLAY and BBNET servers.
  Build a new daemon to run on the BBNET servers. It
  establishes a persistent connection to bbd using
  "bbnetd BBLOCATION" message, and then waits for
  bb-hosts entries to arrive. When one arrives,
  write it to a temp file and then launch bbtest-net
  using that file as bb-hosts.
  On the BBDISPLAY side, fork off a separate process
  to handle the bbnetd stuff and register the link
  between the BBLOCATION and the socket so only 
  relevant stuff is pushed to each bbnetd daemon.
  Would allow for "Test Now" functionality, and might
  also be used for pushing config updates to BBNET 
  servers without having to open up more ports.
* Re-implement bbd using ucspi-tcp "tcpserver" to
  catch incoming messages and store them to a file.
  Maybe restrict incoming messages to status/page only ?
  The disable/enable/notes messages could go via a unix 
  socket, so they could only be local.
  Then run a processing task to move messages off
  to the logs/ directory, generate web pages,
  initiate paging etc.
  Another cool feature would be to sign messages with
  a key installed on the sender system. Perhaps for
  "dangerous" messages only - disable/enable, notes,
* Switch to using a DB for storing messages.
