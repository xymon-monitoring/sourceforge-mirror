Stuff that standard BB does which bbgen/bbtest-net does not
-----------------------------------------------------------
* Handle the missing fping.sh extensions (IP ranges).
* Handle modem banks
* Handle "group" as mkbb.sh does
* Convert the mkbwml.sh script to generate WAP pages.
  Does anyone use WAP phones anymore ?
* Convert the acklog.sh extension for bb2.html. This does
  not load the system a great deal (at least for me), so
  doing it via the existing script as an extension is OK.
  Ought to be converted, especially for use with alternate
  pagesets (currently, all ack-logs go onto the bb2 page,
  even for hosts that are not included in the current pageset).

Suggestions from users
----------------------
* When a host exists on multiple pages, provide links to
  the other pages showing this host. Maybe from the "info"
  column view ?
* Something similar to "badconn" for all tests (Torsten
  Richter on bb list).

Ideas of my own
---------------
* Some way of defining acceptable responsetimes for 
  services, and then go yellow/red if the threshold is 
  exceeded.
* libcurl can support LDAP queries. So implement support
  for running ldap checks, if the runtime library does.
  Hmm ... apparently it does not work :-( and the curl
  guys dont want to support it anymore :-((
  Cf. curl bug item #735752
* Dynamic schedules. When a test fails, we want to test
  it sooner than normal to quickly pick up when it goes
  OK again. However, if a test fails and it stays in 
  the failed mode for some time, we dont want to spend
  a lot of energy retesting it.
  Initial guess: When it fails, do the next 5 tests with
  one minute intervals. Then if the failure persists,
  back off to 2 minute intervals for 5 tests, then 4
  minute intervals for 5 tests etc. until we test only
  once an hour. That means an increased test rate for
  the first 5*(1+2+4) = 35 minutes and then we go to
  a slower than normal test frequency.
  This should be configurable on a per host and/or 
  per service basis.
* Fixed schedules. Some hosts may require testing more
  often than others.
* Use Autoconf. Need to learn how to use it first, though.

If I have too much time someday
-------------------------------
* BB reporting sucks. But how should a good report
  feature be ?
* Re-implement bbd using ucspi-tcp "tcpserver" to
  catch incoming messages and store them to a file.
  Maybe restrict incoming messages to status/page only ?
  The disable/enable/notes messages could go via a unix 
  socket, so they could only be local.
  Then run a processing task to move messages off
  to the logs/ directory, generate web pages,
  initiate paging etc.
  Another cool feature would be to sign messages with
  a key installed on the sender system. Perhaps for
  "dangerous" messages only - disable/enable, notes,
* Perhaps switch to using a DB for storing messages.
