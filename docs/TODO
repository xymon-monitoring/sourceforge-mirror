  Subject: {bb} Bbgen depends not working for conn tests
    10.0.0.1     host1.domain.com #   depends=(conn:host2.domain.com/conn)
    10.0.0.2     host2.domain.com #
  Both hosts have red connectivity.  My understanding is that since host2
  can't be pinged, host1's conn test should be clear, not red. Is this
  right?

  Analysis: "depends" is not evaluated for "conn" tests, 
  only the "router" setting is. Simple fix would be to
  change "conn" dependencies into router tags on the fly,
  or implement "depends" throughout and treat "route"
  as a special-case of depends.


Things I must remember to look at
---------------------------------
* DOWNTIME on a per-test basis.
* hobbitd_client process/disk alarms to different people depending
  on *which* process/disk is in error.
* CLASS tags for hobbit-alerts.cfg and hobbit-clients.cfg, to get
  away from host/page name configs. Hosts can have a CLASS tag
  defining them as belonging to one or more classes; the client-
  and alert-config can then trigger on a class setting.
* Configuration of which graph(s) to show by default, including 
  limiting it to e.g. one of the 7 disk graphs. Ref. mail from
  Charles Jones 15-feb-2005.
  What we really want to do is customize on a per host/test
  basis which graphs appear for which tests. So this means some
  way of customizing hobbitsvc.cgi to include specific graphs.
* Something similar to larrd-graphs.cgi for picking out a bunch
  of graphs to show on one page.
* Move all of the bbtest-net "badFOO" etc. stuff away from bbtest-net
  and into hobbitd.

  2. the NOPROP(RED|YELLOW|..) command in the BB-hosts file works as
  announced, but I am looking for a possibility to tell NOPROP a "level"
  of propagation. This means that an alarm should propagate to its
  sub-page, but not further up to the main page.


Improvements
------------
* hobbitgraph.cgi change to make zoom work in two dimensions. 
  Requires RRDtool 1.2.x.
* More reports: Check out bb-reports on deadcat
* Multi-line macros in hobbit-alerts.cfg
* Allow for regex's in the TCP response match code.
* Merging of alerts based on some criteria, e.g. merge all
  purple alerts for a host into one message.
* Implement "--follow" in the new HTTP tester.
* https proxying (proxy CONNECT protocol)
* Optionally hide the URL and content output from HTTP/content
  checks for "security reasons". Marco Avvisano, 20-sep-2004.
* Set a "BASE" URL in the content status message, so the web
  page we show will link back to the original page for images etc.
* Provide a way of sending http status-messages with individual
  test (column) names for each URL - apparently, Big Sister does
  this. Suggested by Darshan Purandare. Repeated by Scott Walker.
* Provide a way for a "cont" check to NOT be included in the
  "http" column. Suggested by Kim Scarborough.
* Allow for enable/disable of TCP response check per host/service.
* Use the "acked" gif for subpage/page/etc. links when there
  are only acked tests on the page. Marco Avvisano.
* Handle "summary" pages for alternate pagesets. Need to find a way
  of detecting what color a page has when it was NOT generated by
  the current pageset (allowing for summaries across pagesets).
* Improve the history colorbars in cases where there are many
  shortlived statuses. They should not automatically be given 1
  pixel each, as that will cause the history graph to be *very*
  wide.
* Display-only tags should work on duplicate host-entries in bb-hosts,
  e.g. you should be able to put a "NAME:foo" tag on a host and have it
  show up with different names for the same host.

Various ideas that have appeared on the BB mailing list
-------------------------------------------------------
* A report generater capable of displaying for a certain time frame:
  1) List of the top XX "host.service" state changes.  This is to help us
     understand what is barking the most in our environment and focus efforts
     on fixing chronic issues rather than band aiding.
  2) List of lowest XX "Availablity" for host.service.
  And since I am throwing things out, how about embedding a 13 week rolling
  availability into the status/history page?
