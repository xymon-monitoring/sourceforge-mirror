Probably
--------
* Convert the mkbwml.sh script to generate WAP pages

Probably not
------------
* Handle modem banks
* Handle "group" properly
* Convert the acklog.sh extension for bb2.html. This does
  not load the system a great deal (at least for me), so
  doing it via the existing script as an extension is OK.

Suggestions from users
----------------------
* Provide a means to add a "text-line" in the middle of a 
  display group. The text line would look like the group 
  heading, but allow to have a single display group with
  common column headings, but still visually split into
  sets of hosts.
  This could be implemented by having pseudo "hosts"
  that would trigger this. Or maybe a new type of group
  records ?
* Allow generation of the bb2.html / bbnk.html for 
  alternate pagesets, and have the eventlog&acklog show only
  events for the hosts that are part of this pageset.
  NB: This would require re-doing the acklog as part of
  bbgen, instead of via the current standard BB extension
  script.
* When a host exists on multiple pages, provide links to
  the other pages showing this host. Maybe from the "info"
  column view ?
