Bugfixes
--------
* Fix "summary" pages for alternate pagesets. Need to find a way
  of detecting what color a page has when it was NOT generated by
  the current pageset (allowing for summaries across pagesets).
* Improve the history colorbars in cases where there are many
  shortlived statuses. They should not automatically be given 1
  pixel each, as that will cause the history graph to be *very*
  wide.

Improvements
------------
* Send a non-green status to NK for all colors, to catch purple
  alerts
* Show "real" status while disabled, just make status blue while
  we have a planned outage.
* Copy existing .htaccess files when generating reports, instead
  of re-generating them from the env. variable templates. Useful
  when people setup their htaccess by hand and want them to be
  applied to reports as well.
* Handle the missing fping.sh extensions ("range" and "list" tags).
  These are useful for hosts with multiple IP's, e.g. routers.
* Build an extension script for BBNET servers to frequently pull
  a "hot-list" of tests to run from the BBDISPLAY server. This
  could be implemented as a new BB config file that would be 
  dynamically updated by a CGI-script, then pulled across to the
  BBNET server, and fed to bbtest-net. This would enable something
  like the "Test now" function in Unicenter.
* Provide a way of sending http status-messages with individual
  test (column) names for each URL - apparently, Big Sister does
  this. Suggested by Darshan Purandare.

If I have too much time someday
-------------------------------
* Use Autoconf. Need to learn how to use it first, though.
* Re-implement bbd e.g. using ucspi-tcp "tcpserver" to
  catch incoming messages and store them to a file.
  Maybe restrict incoming messages to status/page only ?
  The disable/enable/notes messages could go via a unix 
  socket, so they could only be local.
  Then run a processing task to move messages off
  to the logs/ directory, generate web pages,
  initiate paging etc.
* Another cool feature would be to sign messages with
  a key installed on the sender system. Perhaps for
  "dangerous" messages only - disable/enable, notes,
* Switch to using a DB for storing messages.
