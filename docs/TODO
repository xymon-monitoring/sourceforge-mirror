Bugfixes
--------
* Handle FPING being set to e.g. "sudo fping -r2"
* It's been reported that bbtest-net crashes when trying
  to do http tests via an MS ISA Proxy server that requires
  authentication. This is still being investigated.

Improvements
------------
* Implement "--follow" in the new HTTP tester.
* Allow for some tags (e.g. badconn) to be set for all hosts.
* https proxying (proxy CONNECT protocol)
* Optionally hide the URL and content output from HTTP/content
  checks for "security reasons". Marco Avvisano, 20-sep-2004.
* Set a "BASE" URL in the content status message, so the web
  page we show will link back to the original page for images etc.
* Provide a way of sending http status-messages with individual
  test (column) names for each URL - apparently, Big Sister does
  this. Suggested by Darshan Purandare.
* Provide a way for a "cont" check to NOT be included in the
  "http" column. Suggested by Kim Scarborough.
* Allow for enable/disable of TCP response check per host/service.
* Use the "acked" gif for subpage/page/etc. links when there
  are only acked tests on the page. Marco Avvisano.
* Handle "summary" pages for alternate pagesets. Need to find a way
  of detecting what color a page has when it was NOT generated by
  the current pageset (allowing for summaries across pagesets).
* Improve the history colorbars in cases where there are many
  shortlived statuses. They should not automatically be given 1
  pixel each, as that will cause the history graph to be *very*
  wide.
* Build an extension script for BBNET servers to frequently pull
  a "hot-list" of tests to run from the BBDISPLAY server. This
  could be implemented as a new BB config file that would be 
  dynamically updated by a CGI-script, then pulled across to the
  BBNET server, and fed to bbtest-net. This would enable something
  like the "Test now" function in Unicenter.

Various ideas that have appeared on the BB mailing list
-------------------------------------------------------
* A report generater capable of displaying for a certain time frame:
  1) List of the top XX "host.service" state changes.  This is to help us
     understand what is barking the most in our environment and focus efforts
     on fixing chronic issues rather than band aiding.
  2) List of lowest XX "Availablity" for host.service.
  And since I am throwing things out, how about embedding a 13 week rolling
  availability into the status/history page?

* Comma-separated output from the report generator, to allow importing
  into a spreadsheet or similar. Suggested by Asif Iqbal.
