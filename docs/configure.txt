Configuration script for Hobbit

This script asks a few questions and builds a Makefile to compile Hobbit

Are you setting up a Hobbit server (hobbit), or using Hobbit with BB (bb) [hobbit] ?

Checking pre-requisites for building Hobbit

Checking for fping ...
Found fping in /usr/local/sbin/fping
Checking to see if '/usr/local/sbin/fping 127.0.0.1' works ...
This program can only be run by root, or it must be setuid root.

Failed to run fping.
If fping is not suid-root, you may want to use an suid-root wrapper
like 'sudo' to run fping.

Hobbit needs the fping utility. What command should it use to run fping ?
sudo /usr/local/sbin/fping
Checking to see if 'sudo /usr/local/sbin/fping 127.0.0.1' works ...
127.0.0.1 is alive
OK, will use 'sudo /usr/local/sbin/fping' for ping tests
NOTE: If you are using an suid-root wrapper, make sure the 'hobbit'
      user is also allowed to run fping without having to enter passwords.
      For 'sudo', add something like this to your 'sudoers' file:
      hobbit: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/sbin/fping



Checking for RRDtool ...
Found RRDtool include files in /usr/local/rrdtool-1.0.49/include
Found RRDtool libraries in /usr/local/rrdtool-1.0.49/lib
Linking RRD with PNG library: -L/usr/lib -lpng


Checking for PCRE ...
Found PCRE include files in /usr/include
Found PCRE libraries in /usr/lib


Checking for OpenSSL ...
Found OpenSSL include files in /usr/include
Found OpenSSL libraries in /usr/lib

Hobbit can use the OpenSSL library to test SSL-enabled services
like POP3S, IMAPS, NNTPS and TELNETS. If you have the OpenSSL
library installed, I recommend that you enable this.

Do you want to be able to test SSL-enabled services (y) ?




Checking for LDAP ...
Found LDAP include files in /usr/include
Found LDAP libraries in /usr/lib

Hobbit can use your OpenLDAP LDAP client library to test LDAP servers.

Do you want to be able to test LDAP servers (y) ?

Enable experimental support for LDAP/SSL (OpenLDAP 2.x only) (y) ?




Setting up for a Hobbit server


What userid will be running Hobbit [hobbit] ?

Found passwd entry for user hobbit:x:502:502:Hobbit server:/usr/local/hobbit:/bin/bash


Where do you want the Hobbit installation [/usr/local/hobbit] ?

OK, will configure to use /usr/local/hobbit as the Hobbit toplevel directory


What URL will you use for the Hobbit webpages [/hobbit] ? 



Where to put the Hobbit CGI scripts [/usr/local/hobbit/cgi-bin] ? 



What is the URL for the Hobbit CGI directory [/hobbit-cgi] ? 



** Note that you may need to modify your webserver configuration.
** After installing, see /usr/local/hobbit/server/etc/hobbit-apache.conf for an example configuration.


To generate Hobbit availability reports, your webserver
must have write-access to a directory below the Hobbit
top-level directory. I can set this up if you tell me
what group-ID your webserver runs with. This is typically
'nobody' or 'apache' or 'www-data'
If you dont know, just hit ENTER and we will handle it later.

What group-ID does your webserver use ?
apache


Where to put the Hobbit logfiles [/var/log/hobbit] ? 



What is the name of this host [osiris.hswn.dk] ? 



What is the IP-address of this host [127.0.0.1] ? 
172.16.10.100


Where should I install the Hobbit man-pages (/usr/local/man) ?



The Hobbit history webpage by default displays a 1-day
graph of the history. It can also show a 1-week, 4-weeks and
1-year graphs, or any combination of these.

Which graphs to show by default (1d/1w/4w/1y/all) [all]



The Hobbit history webpage can use a new method to
create the summary graphs on the history page. This method
gives a more accurate view (more detailed), but uses a fixed-width
graph instead of the standard Big Brother graph that automatically
resizes to fit your browser window.

Use the new detailed Hobbit history graph (y/n) [y] ? 

   Tell me the display width (in pixels) to use for
   the history graph. This could be anything, but to
   eliminate as many rounding errors as possible, it
   is best to use a multiple of 24.
   The default value (960) is good on 1024x768 displays

   What width should I use for the graph [960] ? 




Using Linux Makefile settings



Created Makefile with the necessary information to build Hobbit
Some defaults are used, so do look at the Makefile before continuing.

Configuration complete - now run 'make' (GNU make) to build the tools
osiris:~/hobbit $
