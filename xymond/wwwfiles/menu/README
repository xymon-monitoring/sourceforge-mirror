This JavaScript code is the "Tigra Menu", available from
http://www.softcomplex.com/products/tigra_menu/

The closest thing to a license is
http://www.softcomplex.com/products/tigra_menu/docs/#terms_cond
which states:

   There is no license fee or royalty fee to be paid at any 
   time for using the Tigra Menu v1.x
   You may include the source code or modified source code within 
   your own projects for either personal or commercial use but
   excluding the restrictions outlined below. The following 
   restrictions apply to all parts of the component, including all
   source code, samples and documentation.

    a. The above items CAN NOT be sold as are, either individually 
       or together.
    b. The above items CAN NOT be modified and then sold as a library 
       component, either individually or together.

This refers to "Tigra Menu v1.x", but the available version on the 
website is v2.0.

The FAQ at http://www.softcomplex.com/products/tigra_menu/download.html
states:

   Nothing is free. What's the trick here?
   You will not believe - no tricks. This software component and 
   all its support materials are absolutely free of charge now and 
   forever. We don't run advertising on the site, we don't sell your 
   email addresses to spammers, we don't charge for answering your 
   questions in support forum and we don't ask you to put our names 
   on your t-shirt.

So I am assuming that it is OK to distribute Tigra Menu with Hobbit.
