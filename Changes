Changes from 4.0 -> 4.0.2
-------------------------
Bugfixes:
* "meta" reports could crash hobbitd.
* Parsing of HTTP responses could crash bbtest-net.
* Eventlog entries from hosts not in bb-hosts would crash
  the eventlog CGI reporting tool.
* bbgen would crash when FQDN was set to FALSE (not default)
  and a host was in bb-hosts with the fully-qualified name.
* The external rrd-module might launch more than one script
  simultaneously, which resulted in the status message being
  lost.
* AS/400 disk reports were not handled correctly by the RRD
  module, since the format was different from what was expected.
* bbtest-net would do DNS lookups of hostnames when run with the
  "--dns=ip" option, causing a severe slowdown.
* When viewing historical disk reports from Unix systems, the
  "Status unchanged in ..." message might be included in the
  last line of the disk status report, instead of being on a
  line by itself at the bottom of the page.
* "badconn" tags were not being recognized. Eric Schwimmer 
  found the problem and even provided a patch.
* On Solaris, the HOME environment variable may not be defined 
  if Hobbit is started from a bootup-script. This caused
  network tests to stop running.
* Historical logs that are saved when a host is disabled or
  goes purple would not reflect the blue/purple color, but
  the color of the status before it was disabled or went purple.
* A spelling error in the hobbitgraph.cfg file caused the
  hobbitgraph CGI to crash when trying to generate mailq graphs.
* Some BSD systems do not have an atoll() routine, which broke
  compilation of the hobbitd_larrd module. Switched to use Hobbit's
  own atoll() for this platform.
* Duration-times could be mis-reported on the "info" page, due to
  some bad math done when building this page.

Improvements:
* In bb-hosts you can now define a host called ".default." - the tags
  set for this host will be the default tag settings for the following
  hosts (until a new .default. host appears).
* Merged the bb-infocolumn and bb-larrdcolumn functionality into
  the service-display CGI, and make bb-hostsvc into a Hobbit-only
  CGI called hobbitsvc.cgi. The bb-infocolumn and bb-larrdcolumn
  binaries have been removed.
* --alertcolors, --okcolors and --repeat options for hobbitd,
  hobbitd_alert and bb-infocolumn were moved to settings in
  hobbitserver.cfg (ALERTCOLORS, OKCOLORS and ALERTREPEAT 
  respectively).
* A new generic RRD handler was added for name-colon-value reports.
  This can be used to handle RRD tracking of reports where the data
  is in lines of the form "Name: Value".
* New "notrends" tag for bb-hosts entries drops the "trends" tag
  for a host (similar to the "noinfo" tag).
* New "DOC:" tag for bb-hosts entries lets you set a documentation
  URL for each host, or as a default using the ".default." hostname.
  The --docurl option on bb-infocolumn (which no longer exists) has
  been dropped.
* Included the "hobbitreports.sh" script to show how reports can be 
  pre-generated by a cron-job.
* New "bb-datepage.cgi" CGI makes it easy to select daily/weekly/monthly
  pre-generated reports. 
* The hobbitgraph CGI now allows you to show weekday- and month-names in
  your local language, instead of forcing it to english. Note that the
  fonts used may not include all non-ASCII characters.
* CPU-reports from the bb-xsnmp.pl script should now be handled correctly
  by the RRD module.
* CPU-reports for z/VM should now be handled correctly by the RRD module.
* CPU-, disk- and memory-reports from the nwstats2bb script are now 
  handled by the RRD module.


Changes from 4.0 -> 4.0.1
-------------------------
Bugfixes:
* Compiling Hobbit on some platforms would fail due to a couple
  of missing standard include files not being pulled in.


Changes from RC-6 -> 4.0
-------------------------
Bugfixes:
* DOWNTIME handling was broken in some cases. While fixing this,
  it was also enhanced to allow multiple day-specifications in 
  a single time-specification, e.g. "60:2200:2330" is now valid
  way of defining downtime between 10 PM and 11:30 PM on Saturday
  and Sunday.
* If bbtest-net was run with "--dns=ip" option to disable DNS
  lookups, a DHCP host could not be tested. Changed so that hosts
  with a "0.0.0.0" IP-address always do a DNS lookup to determine
  the IP-address for network tests.
* Links in the RSS file were missing a trailing slash.
* Disk- and CPU-reports from AS/400 based systems were not handled
  properly by the RRD parser. Note that this change means the PCRE
  library is now needed for the hobbitd_larrd module.
* The default hobbitlaunch.cfg had the environment path for the
  bbcombotest task hard-coded, instead of picking up the configuration
  value.
* Back out the cookie-based filtering of hosts in the Enable/Disable
  (maint.pl) script - it breaks in too many places. Need further
  investigation.
* Alert rules with the STOP and UNMATCHED keywords now flag this on
  the info-page alert table.
* If a host was removed from the bb-hosts file, and hobbitd reloaded
  the file before a "drop" command was sent, then it was impossible to
  get rid of the internal state stored for the host without restarting
  Hobbit.
* Disabled status-logs could go purple while still being disabled,
  this would show up as the status alternating between blue and purple.

Improvements:
* If invoking fping failed, the error message was lost and only
  a "failed with exit code 99" error was reported. Changed so that
  the real cause of the error is reported in the bbtest-net log.
* An "mrtg" definition was added to hobbitgraph.cfg, to handle
  MRTG generated RRD files. If MRTG is configured to save RRD files
  directly to the Hobbit rrd-directory, these graphs can be handled
  as if they were native Hobbit graphs. Wrote up hobbit-mrtg.html to
  describe this setup.
* When hosts are removed from the bb-hosts file, all in-memory data
  stored about the host is dropped automatically, so e.g. alerts will
  no longer be sent out. Data stored on disk is unaffected; this only
  gets removed when a "drop" command is issued.
* Time-specifications now accept multiple week-days, e.g. you can 
  define a host that is down Sunday and Monday 20:00->23:00 with
  "DOWNTIME=01:2000:2300". This applies globally, so also applies to
  alert-specifications and other time-related settings using the NKTIME
  syntax. It will also complain rather loudly in the logfile is an
  invalid time-specification is found in one of the configuration files.
* hobbit-mailack added to the HTML man-page index and to the overview
  description in hobbit(7).
* A new "trimhistory" tool was added, allowing you to trim the size of
  history logs and historical status-log collections.


Changes from RC-5 -> RC-6
-------------------------
Bugfixes:
* Recovery messages were sent to all recipients, regardless
  of any color-restrictions on the alerts they received. Changed
  this so that recipients only get recovery messages for the
  alerts they received.

* The "NOALERT" option was not applied when multiple recipients
  were listed in one rule.

* bbtest-net now performs a syntax check on all URL's before
  adding them to the test queue. This should stop it from 
  crashing in case you happen to enter a syntactically invalid
  URL in your bb-hosts file.

* The acknowledgment log on the BB2 page could mix up data from
  different entries in the log.

* The default mail-utility used to send out e-mail alerts is
  now defined per OS. Solaris and HP-UX use "mailx", others
  use "mail".

* Client tests no longer go purple when a host has been 
  disabled.

* bb-larrdcolumn no longer dumps core if there are no RRD files.

* With the right input, bb-larrdcolumn could use massive amounts of
  memory and eventually terminate with an out-of-memory error.

* A memory leak in hobbitd_larrd handling of "disk" reports was fixed.

* bb-infocolumn now accepts a "--repeat=N" setting to inform it of
  the default alert-repeat interval. If you use --repeat with 
  hobbitd_alert, you should copy that option to bb-infocolumn to 
  make it generate correct info-column pages.

* If bbgen cannot create output files or directories, the underlying
  error is now reported in the error message.

* The "merge-lines" and "merge-sects" tools used during installation
  could crash due to a missing initialization of a pointer.


Improvements:
* It is now possible to make Hobbit re-open all logfiles,
  e.g. after a log rotate. Use "server/hobbit.sh rotate".

* The hobbit-mailack tool now recognizes the BB format of 
  alert message responses, i.e. putting "delay" and "msg"
  in the subject line will work.

* bbcmd defaults to running /bin/sh if no command is given

* hobbitd_larrd now logs the sender IP of a message that
  results in an error.

* A network test definition for SpamAssassin's spamd daemon
  was added.

* The default web/*header files now refer to a HOBBITLOGO setting
  for the HTML used in the upper-left corner of all pages. The 
  default is just the text "Hobbit", but you can easily replace
  this with e.g. a company logo by changing this setting in
  hobbitserver.cfg.

* The Hobbit daemon's "hobbitdboard", "hobbitdxboard" and 
  "hobbitdlist" commands now support a set of primitive filtering
  techniques to limit the number of hosts returned.

* maint.pl uses the new Hobbit daemon filtering and a cookie defined
  by the header in webpages to show only the hosts found on the
  page where it was called from, or just a single host.

* Hobbit should now compile on Mac OS X (Darwin).

* The info- and graph-column names are now defined globally as
  environment variables "INFOCOLUMN" and "LARRDCOLUMN", respectively.
  This eliminates the need to have them listed as options for multiple
  commands. Consequently, the --larrd and --info options have been 
  dropped.

* Systems with the necessary libraries (RRDtool, PCRE, OpenSSL etc) in
  unusual locations can now specify the location of these as parameters
  to the configure script, overriding the auto-detect routine. See
  "./configure --help" for details.

* A definition for the "disk1" graph in LARRD was added, this shows the
  actual use of filesystems instead of the normal percentage.



Changes from RC-4 -> RC-5
-------------------------
Bugfixes:
* Very large status- or data-messages could overflow the shared
  memory segment used for communication between hobbitd and the
  worker modules. This would cause hobbitd to crash. Such messages
  are now truncated before being passed off to worker modules.

* hobbitd_alert no longer crashes when trying to send a message.

* Recovery messages were sent, even when no alert message had
  been sent. This caused unexpected "green" messages. 

* The router dependency "route" tag handling was broken.


Improvements:
* The "starthobbit.sh" script now refuses to start Hobbit if it
  is already running.

* The "starthobbit.sh" script was renamed to just "hobbit.sh".
  It now also supports a "reload" command that causes hobbitd
  to reload the bb-hosts file.

* The bb-hist CGI now supports the NAME tag for naming hosts.

* The history CGI's showed the Host- and service-names twice 
  when in Hobbit mode. Once is enough.

* A "NOALERT" setting in hobbit-alerts.cfg was implemented, so
  it is easier to define recipients who only get notice-messages
  and not alerts.

* The input parameter check for CGI scripts was relaxed, so that
  special characters are permitted - e.g. when passing a custom
  hostname to a CGI. Since we do not use any shell scripts in 
  CGI handling, this should not cause any security problem.


Building Hobbit:
* The /opt/sfw directory is now searched for libraries (Solaris).

* The order of libssl and libcrypto has been swapped, to avoid
  linker problems on some platforms.



Changes from RC-3 -> RC-4
-------------------------

Bugfixes:
* Loading the bb-services file no longer causes bbtest-net,
  hobbitd_larrd et al to crash.
* The alert configuration loader was fixed, so that
  recipient criteria are applied correctly.
* hobbitd_alert handling of "recovered" status messages was
  slightly broken. This was probably the cause of the
  unexpected "green" alerts that some have reported.
* SCRIPT recipients can now have a "@" in their names without
  being silently treated as MAIL recipients.
* An acknowledge message is now cleared when the status changes
  to an OK color (defined by the --okcolors option). Previously
  it would have to go "green" before the ack was cleared.
* Acked and disabled statuses can not go purple while the
  acknowledge or disable is valid. This was causing brief flickers
  of purple for tests that were disabled for more than 30 minutes.
* maint.pl "combo" message support was dropped. This was causing
  runtime warnings, and it has never been possible to send enable
  or disable messages inside combo's (neither with Hobbit nor BB).


Building Hobbit:
* bb-infocolumn should build without problems again.

* The "configure" script now also looks in /opt/csw for
  tools and libraries (for Solaris/x86)

* An OpenBSD Makefile was contributed.

* The gcc option "-Wl,--rpath" is now used when linking
  the tools on Linux and *BSD. This should resolve a lot of
  the issues with runtime libraries that cannot be found.

* "configure" now looks for your perl utility, and adjusts
  the maint.pl script accordingly.

* HP-UX does not have an atoll() routine. So a simple 
  implementation of this routine was added.


Configuration file changes:
* hobbitlaunch.cfg now supports a DISABLED keyword to shut
  off unwanted tasks. This permits upgrading without having
  to re-disable stuff.
* All commands in hobbitserver.cfg are now quoted, so it
  can be sourced by the CGI scripts without causing errors.
  Note that this is NOT automatically changed in an existing
  configuration file.


Improvements:
* The detailed status display now lets you define what graphs
  should be split onto multiple graph images (the "--multigraphs"
  option for bb-hostsvc.cgi and hobbitd_filestore). Currently
  the "disk", "inode" and "qtree" graphs are handled this way.
* The detailed status display now includes a line showing how
  long an acknowledgment is valid. This is configurable via the
  ACKUNTILMSG setting in hobbitserver.cfg.
* A new "notify" message is supported as part of the Hobbit 
  protocol. This takes a normal hostname+testname paramater,
  plus a text message; this is sent out as an informational
  message using the hobbit-alerts.cfg rules to determine recipients.
  This replaces the BB "notify-admin" recipient with a more
  fine-grained and configurable system. Currently used by
  maint.pl when enabling and disabling tests.
* Alert scripts now receive a CFID environment variable with the
  linenumber of the hobbit-alerts.cfg file that caused this
  alert to go out.
* A new tool - hobbit-mailack - was added. If setup to run from
  e.g. the Hobbit users' .procmailrc file, you can acknowledge
  alerts by responding to an alert email.
* Temperature reports now accept additional text in parenthesis
  without being confused.



Changes from RC-2 -> RC-3
-------------------------

Configuration file changes:
* The bb-services file format was changed slightly.
  Instead of "service foo" to define a service, it is
  now "[foo]". Existing files will be converted 
  automatically by "make install".
  
* The name of the "conn" column (for ping-tests) is used
  throughout Hobbit, and had to be set in multiple locations.
  Changed all of them to use the setting from the PINGCOLUMN
  environment variable, and added this to hobbitserver.cfg.

* The --purple-conn option was dropped from hobbitd.
  It should be removed from hobbitlaunch.cfg.

* The --ping=COLUMNNAME option for bbtest-net should not
  be used any more. "--ping" enables the ping tests, the
  name of the column is taken from the PINGCOLUMN variable.

* The GRAPHS setting in hobbitserver.cfg no longer needs to
  have the simple TCP tests defined. These are automatically
  picked up from the bb-services file.

Bugfixes:
* hobbitd no longer crashes, if the MACHINE name from 
  hobbitserver.cfg is not listed in bb-hosts. Thanks to
  Stephen Beaudry for helping me track down this bug.

* If hobbitd crashed, then hobbitlaunch would attempt
  to restart it immediately. Added a 5 second delay,
  so that there's time for the OS to clean up any open
  sockets, files etc that might prevent a restart from
  working.

* The "disk" RRD handler could be confused by reports 
  from a Unix server, and mistake it for a report from a
  Windows server. This caused the report to try and store
  data in an RRD file with an invalid filename, so no
  graph-data was being stored.

* The "cpu" and "disk" RRD handlers were enhanced to support 
  reports from the "filerstats2bb" script for monitoring NetApp
  systems. The disk-handler also supports the "inode" and "qtree"
  reports from the same script.

* bb-services was overwritten by a "make install". This
  wiped out custom network test definitions.

* bbnet would crash if you happened to define a "http"
  or "https" test instead of using a full URL.

* bbnet was mis-calculating the size of the URL used for th
  apache-test. This could cause it to overflow a buffer and
  crash.

* hobbitd would ignore the BBPORT setting and always default
  to using port 1984.

* Portability problems on HP-UX 11 should be resolved. From
  reports it appears that building RRDtool on HP-UX 11 is 
  somewhat of a challenge; however, the core library is
  all that Hobbit needs, so build-problems with the Perl
  modules can be ignored as far as Hobbit is concerned.

* hobbitd_alert could not handle multiple recipients for scripts,
  and mistakenly assumed all recipients with a "@" were for
  e-mail recipients.

* Alert messages no longer include the "<!-- flags:... ->"
  summary; this is for Hobbit internal use only.

* "suse" and "mandrake" are recognized as aliases for "linux"
  in the RRD handler.


Improvements:
* The info-pages now list the Hobbit alert configuration.

* hobbitd_alert now has a "--trace=FILENAME" option. This 
  causes it to log a complete trace of all messages received
  from hobbitd, and how they are handled and what alerts get
  sent out as a result. This should help in tracking down
  alert problems.

* New FORMAT=PLAIN setting for alert recipients. This is the
  same as FORMAT=TEXT, except that the URL link to the status-
  page is left out of the message.

* The "setup" target for make has been removed. "make install"
  will now do all of the work, and will also merge in any
  added settings to the hobbitserver.cfg, hobbitgraph.cfg,
  hobbitlaunch.cfg, columndoc.csv and bb-services files.
  The standard files in ~/server/web/ and ~/server/www/ are
  also updated, if a previous version of the standard file
  is found.

* The graph included on a status view page can now be 
  zoomed directly, without having to go over the "view all
  period graphs" page.

* Color-names in hobbit-alerts.cfg are now case-insensitive.

* If the "acknowledge alert" webpage is password-protected,
  the login-username is now included in the acknowledge 
  message. This will also appear in the BB2 acknowledgement
  log display, and on the status page.

* More tips added to the "Tips & Tricks" document: How to get
  temperature graphs with Fahrenheit, how to configure Apache
  to allow viewing of the CGI man-pages.

* A native MD5 message-digest routine was added, so content-
  checks using digests will work even when Hobbit is built
  without OpenSSL support. The routine was taken from
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/libmd5-rfc/

* bb-findhost CGI will let you search for IP-adresses.

* The "--recentgifs" option to bbgen now has a parameter,
  so you can specify what the threshold is for a status to have
  changed "recently". The default is 24 hours.


Changes from RC-1 -> RC-2
-------------------------

Bugfixes:
* The alert module now gets color changes that move a status from
  critical (alert) state into a not-yet-recovered state. So if you 
  only want pages on red, you should no longer see pages when it
  goes from red to yellow.

* Alert rules with a color specification followed by some other
  criteria would ignore the color spec.

* Alerts would only get repeated when a new message arrived, not
  necessarily with the interval set by the REPEAT configuration.

* The alert configuration file was reloaded every time. It should
  now only reload when it has been changed. This caused a noticable
  change in hobbitd_alert's CPU usage.

* A MAIL recipient can now have multiple recipients.

* The "iishealth" RRD handler was broken.

* DHCP hosts (those that have an IP of 0.0.0.0) are allowed to report
  their status from any IP.

* The bb-eventlog CGI was cleaned up (now it actually works!) and
  a proper submission form and menu item were added.

* bbtest-net would crash when multiple "apache" tests were defined.

* The bb-ack.sh CGI - when located in the secure CGI area - was posting
  to bb-ack.sh in the unsecure CGI directory. Changed so it always posts
  to the same location it was originally called from.


Improvements:
* Lots of small tweaks to the HTML templates and some code, to ensure
  that all HTML generated is HTML 4.0 compliant. Thanks to Firefox
  and the HTML Validator plugin!

* hobbitgraph.cgi enhanced with a "zoom-in" function taken from the
  Cacti project. This allows zooming in on a period of time. Zoom
  on both axis (time and value) will be implemented in the next version
  of Hobbit, since it requires a modification to the RRDtool library;
  this is too large a change to add currently.

* A handler for the "temperature" reports was added to hobbitd_larrd.

* An external handler mechanism was implemented for hobbitd_larrd, so 
  users can add their own graphs without having to do C coding.

* The "bbcmd" utility now loads the standard hobbitserver.cfg environment
  if no "--env" setting is used on the command line.

* The default for the "find host" form was changed to do a case-insensitive
  match (since hostnames do not normally care about upper- or lower-case).



Changes from beta-6 -> RC-1
---------------------------

* NOTE: The netstat RRD file layout has changed.  You must delete all 
  "netstat.rrd" files, or your data collection will fail. Sorry, but the old 
  LARRD format cannot cope with reality, where some systems report packet 
  counts, some report byte counts, and some have both.

* NOTE: The vmstat RRD file layout has changed, for data collected
  from Linux-based systems. You must delete all such "vmstat.rrd"
  files, or the data collection will fail. There were several 
  incompatible formats of linux vmstat RRD files - now they all
  use the same format.

* Hobbit should now work on AIX, and possibly other platforms
  that enforce strict X/Open XPG4 semantics for the ftok() 
  routine. If you were seeing messages like "Could not generate 
  shmem key..." or "Cannot setup status channel", then these
  should now be fixed. Thanks to Chris Morris for being patient 
  with me while I struggled with the finer details of SVR4 IPC.

* A new "--test" option was implemented for hobbitd_alert. Running
  "hobbitd_alert --test HOSTNAME SERVICENAME" will print out the
  rules that match the HOSTNAME/SERVICENAME combination, so you 
  can see what alerts are triggered. (Note: man-page is not updated
  with this info yet).

* Macros in hobbit-alerts.cfg were broken. Completely.

* Specifying time-values in hobbit-alerts.cfg as "10m" was 
  interpreted as "10 months" instead of "10 minutes". Since
  minutes is much more likely to be useful, the support for
  "months" and "years" was dropped, and "10m" now means minutes.

* Specifying any kind of duration meant that the alert would not
  happen until 24 hours had passed (and the alert still was active).
 
* Two new keywords in the hobbit-alerts.cfg file: 
  STOP on a recipient means that Hobbit stops looking for more 
  recipients after the current one has matched. 
  UNMATCHED on a recipient means that this recipient only 
  gets an alert if no other recipients got an alert (for
  setting up a default catch-all rule).

* A simple syntax for "all hosts" is now "HOST=*" in hobbit-alerts.cfg

* Configuring the Hobbit URL's as a root URL - "http://host/" -
  now works, and yields correct links to the menu, the GIF-
  files, and the documentation.

* The Enable/Disable script (maint.pl) now picks up the menu
  correctly.

* The "configure" script now allows you to select a second
  CGI directory for administration scripts (the ack-script
  and enable/disable script). This second directory is 
  access-controlled; the default Apache configuration was
  updated to show how.

* The ~/server/starthobbit.sh symbolic link was not being
  re-generated if the file already existed (on some platforms).

* The hobbit-tips.html file is now generated during installation,
  so it has correct links to the icons. Previously it assumed 
  that the icon-files had been copied to the www/help/ directory.

* vmstat data for the "I/O wait cpu time" on Linux is now being
  collected. Linux RRD data-formats made identical across the
  various formats that are in use; this means any existing vmstat.rrd
  files from Linux systems must be deleted.

* Support for NetBSD 2.0 in vmstat and netstat RRD handler.

* HTTP authentication strings are now URL un-escaped, so you can
  use any byte-value in the username and/or password.

* The info-column now includes the current address assigned to 
  a DHCP host.

* A new "noinfo" tag can be used to suppress the "info" column on
  selected hosts.

* bbhostgrep no longer segfault's if you do not use the BBLOCATION
  environment setting. This kept some extension scripts from working.

* If every single network test failed, bbtest-net could loop 
  indefinitely. Seen on NetBSD.

* If the number of available file-descriptors (ulimit -n) was
  exceeded, bbtest-net would loop forever. Seen on NetBSD.

* When running http-tests via a proxy that requires authentication,
  the authentication info could not contain a ":" or a "@". The
  authentication info is now un-escaped using the normal URL
  decoding routine, so these characters can be entered as %XX 
  escaped data (e.g. to put a "@" in the password, use "%40").

* LDAP tests now try to select LDAPv3 first, and fallback to
  LDAPv2 if this is not possible. Some newer LDAP servers 
  refuse to talk v2 protocol.

* Memory debugging was accidentally enabled in beta6 - it is now
  disabled.



Changes from beta-5 -> beta-6 (released Jan 23 2005)
----------------------------------------------------

General:
* All environment variables now have default values if
  they haven't been defined in hobbitserver.cfg.


Building:
* Hobbit now builds and appears to work on NetBSD.

* The problems with the "id" command on Solaris should be
  fixed (for real, this time).

* The "configure" script checks for GNU Make, and sets up
  the MAKE variable to run it.

* For automated package builders, the "configure" script will
  use pre-defined settings and not ask questions requiring user
  input.


hobbitlaunch:
* A new HEARTBEAT option was added to hobbitlaunch.cfg. One task
  (hobbitd) can provide a heart-beat by sending hobbitlaunch a
  USR2 signal; if this signal is lost, hobbitlaunch will bounce
  the task.

* When killing tasks, hobbitlaunch will now first try SIGTERM. If
  the task does not terminate, hobbitlaunch will send SIGKILL.

* If some tasks depend on a task that is being killed by hobbitlaunch,
  then the dependant tasks will also be killed.


hobbitd:
* A timeout has been implemented in hobbitd, when it waits for the
  hobbitd workers to pick up the latest message sent to them. If the
  semaphore does not clear in 5 seconds, hobbitd will complain but
  proceed to post the message to the channel. The root cause for this
  happening is not yet fully determined, although two potential causes
  have been identified and corrected. The effect of this happening used
  to be that hobbit would lock up, and all hosts would disappear from
  the display.
  If you see an error-message "BOARDBUSY locked..." I would like to hear
  about it!

* The post-beta5-lockup patch is included. This fixes a bug that could
  cause hobbitd to lockup when being started.

* Error handling in the initial setting up of the hobbitd shared-memory
  and semaphores has been improved and made more verbose.

* A bug in the hobbitd_channel handling of timeouts meant that the
  timeouts were only reported as "Duplicate message". 

* Alerts are now passed to the hobbitd_alert module each time a status
  with an "alert-color" is received. The rules for sending off alerts
  to hobbitd_alert have thus been much simplified and should give a
  more robust behaviour.

* SCRIPT based alert are now also logged.


Status display:
* Disabled tests now have the information from the "disable" 
  message shown on the status page.


RRD graphs:
* The BEA graph definitions have been improved to handle multiple
  instances running on the same node, and to pick up thread information.


Network tests:
* VNC network test definition added.

* The "apache" performance data collector should no longer
  cause the network tests to crash.

* The "apache" configuration now lets you specify the URL
  used to fetch the data, if you e.g. need to provide a
  login/password to get it, or you are using a different
  URL than the default one.



Changes from beta-4 -> beta-5 (released Jan 16 2005)
----------------------------------------------------

hobbitd:
* Dead connections would cause hobbitd to busy-loop
  using CPU time. It will now timeout connections after
  10 seconds (configurable).

* CLIENT tag is now handled regardless of whether "ghost"
  handling is enabled in hobbitd or not.


RRD graphs:
* The "apache" keyword for picking up Apache performance data is
  now documented. This is a bottom feeder for the Apache RRD
  graph data.

* A handler to generate graphs from the "iishealth" extension 
  data was added.

* "netstat" data from Win32 systems running bb_memory were not
  handled properly, so no graph data was being stored.


Alerting:
* The default repeat-interval for alerts can be set as a 
  commandline option.

* A new option to hobbitd, --okcolors=COLOR, allows you
  to specify what color(s) will trigger a "recovered"
  message.


General:
* Memory management is now wrapped in routines that check
  for common errors. This may cause more crashes, but will
  hopefully also make it easier to track down the bugs.


Building:
* The configure script should be able to pick up the PCRE
  include files on Red Hat & Fedora.

* RRDtool installations that require linking with libz
  should now work.

* Compile problems on AIX (conflicting msg_t defintions)
  have been fixed by renaming the hobbit structure.

* Some scripts used "id -g", this caused problems on
  Solaris. Changed to use the XPG4 version of "id" on
  Solaris.


Documentation:
* man-pages for bb-infocolumn, bb-larrdcolumn, bb-webpage 
  hobbit-alerts.cfg added.
  The hobbitserver.cfg man-page was heavily updated.

* Misc. documentation updates and improvements


Network tests:
* C-ARES library updated from version 1.2.0 -> 1.2.1.


Reporting:
* Availability reports would show odd data for hosts that had
  the REPORTTIME option enabled.

* Setting report-generation options in BBGENREPOPTS now works.

* The bb-snapshot.cgi reporting tool is now installed in the 
  menu, and functional out of the box. This tool allows you to
  view a snapshot of the Hobbit webpages at a given point in
  time.

* The report header- and footer-files changed so the menu also
  works in reports.


Changes from beta3 -> beta4 (released Jan 05 2005)
--------------------------------------------------

General changes
---------------
* Bugfixes from bbgen 3.5 included.

* Internally, the code that handles loading of the bb-hosts file in
  the various tools has been consolidated into a single library
  routine. Previously there was 3 or 4 different routines who handled
  loading the bb-hosts file - one for bbgen, another for bbtest-net, a
  third for bbgend/hobbitd etc. Such a change can cause problems,
  since so much functionality depends on getting the right information
  out of the bb-hosts file. So if you stumble across anything that
  might be related to a tool not getting the expected information from
  bb-hosts, do let me know. It's been fairly well tested, but one
  never knows.

* The documentation has been brought up-to-date, and I've added some
  HTML-formatted documentation that is available either in the docs/
  directory of the tar-file, or on-line after you install Hobbit. The
  "install.html" describes how to install Hobbit, if you would like
  some guidance along the way. The column heading links that pointed
  into the bb-help.html file from Big Brother are also gone, since
  this file cannot be redistributed.
  One man-page is currently missing: The hobbit-alerts.cfg(5) man-
  page isn't done yet, but there is an HTML document that describes
  how to setup alerts.



bbgen changes
-------------
* HTML 4.0 compliance was checked for the overview- and status-log
  webpages. Multiple changes in the "web/" templates and hobbitserver.env
  as a result.

* bbgen no longer updates the "info" and "trends" columns.  Instead, two 
  stand-alone utilities handle this. The "--info" and "--larrd" options 
  are no longer used by bbgen. So if upgrading from beta3, you must 
  copy the new [larrdcolumn] and [infocolumn] sections from the default
  hobbitlaunch.cfg file.


hobbitd changes
---------------
* hobbitd can now save "meta" information about each status; this
  is expected to be XML-formatted data. Currently, the "info" and
  "trends" data is stored in this way, if the tools generating it
  are run with the "--meta" option.

* Two new network commands in hobbitd: "hobbitdxlog" returns a status
  log in XML format; "hobbitdxboard" returns the full Hobbit status board
  in XML format.

* hobbitd now handles SIGHUP correctly.


RRD / graphing changes
----------------------
* A replacement for the Perl-based larrd-grapher CGI was implemented.
  This has much lower overhead as a CGI script than the old script,
  so graphs appear a lot quicker and with less load on your server.
  Also, this graph CGI has some improvements, e.g. if multiple 
  graphs are combined (e.g. the tcp graph), the view is split up 
  into multiple graphs. And http response-times are shown on a 
  separate graph, since they are usually much larger than the 
  response-times for normal tcp tests.

* Improved the way RRD graphs are defined. The LARRDS environment
  setting defines what types of status-messages are passed to the
  LARRD backend and how they should be interpreted. The GRAPHS
  environment variable defines what graphs appear on the "trends"
  page.

* The "memory" RRD backend now tracks the "actual" value (for Linux)
  and "Virtual" value (Win32).

* A new RRD graph for bbgend tracks the number of incoming messages.

* The "apache" RRD backend was implemented. Instead of a standalone
  bottom-feeder, data is fed by bbtest-net. So you can enable apache
  reporting simply by putting "apache" as a test in bb-hosts.

* The "sendmail" RRD backend was implemented.
