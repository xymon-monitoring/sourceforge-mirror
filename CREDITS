It would have been hard to implement bbgen without the
existing libraries for lots of stuff:

libCURL (although this is no longer used, it was quite
	 important while it was in use)
	http://curl.haxx.se/
	Daniel Steenberg and others

libCARES
	Based on the ARES library by Greg Hudson of MIT, 
	C-ARES provides asynchronous parallel DNS lookups.
