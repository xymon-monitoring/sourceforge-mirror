.TH LOGFETCH 1 "Version 4.1.2: 11 Oct 2005" "Hobbit Monitor"
.SH NAME
logfetch \- Hobbit client data collector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "logfetch CONFIGFILE STATUSFILE"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlogfetch\fR is part of the Hobbit client. It is responsible
for collecting data from logfiles, and other file-related data,
which is then sent to the Hobbit server for analysis.

logfetch uses a configuration file, which is automatically
retrieved from the Hobbit server. There is no configuration
done locally. The configuration file is usually stored in
the \fB$BBHOME/tmp/logfetch.cfg\fR file, but editing this file has
no effect since it is re-written with data from the Hobbit 
server each time the client runs.

logfetch stores information about what parts of the monitored
logfiles have been processed already in the \fB$BBHOME/tmp/logfetch.status\fR 
file. This file is an internal file used by logfetch, and should
not be edited. If deleted, it will be re-created automatically.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IP DU
Command used to collect information about the size of directories.
By default, this is the standard \fBdu\fR command. If the local
du-command on the client does not report data in KB units, it is
recommended that you set the DU environment variable in the 
\fB$BBHOME/etc/hobbitclient.cfg\fR file so that it will report
data in KB. E.g.
.br
    DU="du -k"
.br
will do this on Solaris.
