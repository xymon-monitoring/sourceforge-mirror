.TH BB-ENVIRON 5 "Version 2.12: 30 Oct 2003" "bbgen toolkit"
.SH NAME
bb-environ \- bbgen specific environment variables

.SH DESCRIPTION
The bbgen toolkit uses some environment variables beside the
normal set of variables defined by the Big Brother configuration
files. This manpage documents these extra environment variables.

For a description of the standard Big Brother environment
variables, please see the Big Brother documentation.

You will normally need to define the bbgen environment variables in
your $BBHOME/etc/bbsys.local file, so that they are available
to the bbgen toolkit programs when they execute as part of
the Big Brother programs. Note that after defining the variable
you should do an "export" on it to make it available to the
other Big Brother programs. Like this:

.br
	NTPDATE=/usr/sbin/ntpdate
.br
	export NTPDATE


.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.IP BBGEN
Defines the location of the
.I bbgen(1)
program. 
.br
Default: $BBHOME/bin/bbgen

.IP BBGHOSTS
The bbd-name+larrd patch for the Big Brother daemon bbd introduces 
a new way of handling status reports from hosts that are not in the
.I bb-hosts(5)
file. What happens is controlled by setting BBGHOSTS to 0, 1 or 2.
.br
By default, these status messages are just stored as if
the hosts were known to the Big Brother system - this behaviour
is what you get if BBGHOSTS is undefined, or set to 0.
.br
BBGHOSTS=1 causes the status report to be silently discarded.
.br
BBGHOSTS=2 also discards the status report, but logs a message
to BBOUT with the hostname that was ignored.
.br
When BBGHOSTS is set to 1 or 2, the hostnames in incoming 
status-messages is matched without any case-sensitivity,
unlike normal Big Brother which is case-sensitive in
hostnames. So with BBGHOSTS set to 1 or 2, "WWW.FOO.COM"
and "www.foo.com" are considered to be the same host.
If necessary, the incoming hostname will be changed
to match the way it is written in the bb-hosts file,
changing case as needed.

.IP BBPORT
The BBPORT variable can be used to override the portnumber
of the bbd daemon that status messages are sent to. bbgen
determines the portnumber from the first of these three
possibilities that yield a valid portnumber:
.br
    * the BBPORT environment variable;
.br
    * the "bbd" entry in /etc/services;
.br
    * the default defined when compiling bbgen

.IP BBMAXMSGSPERCOMBO
The maximum number of status messages to combine into one
combo message. You may need to lower this number of your
BBDISPLAY server has trouble keeping up with the incoming
status messages from bbtest-net.
.br
Default: 0 (unlimited)

.IP BBSLEEPBETWEENMSGS
Length of a pause introduced between each successive transmission
of a combo-message by bbtest-net. You may have to increase this
value to give your BBDISPLAY server time to process one combo
message before the next one arrives. This number defines how
many milliseconds to wait between the messages.
.br
Default: 0 (send messages as quickly as possible).

.IP BBROUTERTEXT
When using the "router" or "depends" tags for a host, a failure
status may include text that an "Intermediate router is down".
With todays network topologies, the router could be a switch or
another network device; if you define this environment variable
the word "router" will be replaced with whatever you put into
the variable. So to inform the users that an intermediate switch
or router is down, use BBROUTERTEXT="switch or router".
.br
This can also be set on a per-host basis using the "DESCR:hosttype:description"
tag, see
.I bb-hosts(5)

.IP MKBB2COLREPEAT
Inspired by Jeff Stoner's col_repeat_patch.tgz patch, this defines
the maximum number of rows before repeating the column headings
on a webpage. This sets the default value for the 
.I bbgen(1)
"--maxrows" option; if the command-line option is also specifed,
then it overrides this environment variable. Note that unlike
Jeff's patch, bbgen implements this for both the bb2.html page
and all other pages (bb.html, subpages, bbnk.html).
.br
Default: 0 (disables the feature)

.IP BBHTACCESS
Defines the contents of the top-level .htaccess file created by bbgen
when run with the --htaccess option. This .htaccess file is
created in the toplevel directory where the bb.html and bb2.html
files are stored.
.br
Default: none

.IP BBPAGEHTACCESS
Defines the contents of the page-level .htaccess file created by bbgen
when run with the --htaccess option. This .htaccess file is
created in the first level directory corresponding the the location
of the "page" webpages. This setting may include a "%s" tag, which will
automatically be expanded to the name of the current page.
.br
Default: none

.IP BBSUBPAGEHTACCESS
Defines the contents of the subpage-level .htaccess file created by bbgen
when run with the --htaccess option. This .htaccess file is
created below the first level directory corresponding the the location
of the "subpage" and "subparent" webpages. This setting may include two "%s" 
tags, which will automatically be expanded to the name of the current page
and subpage, respectively.
.br
Default: none

.IP BBHELPSKIN
The URL prefix used for accessing the Big Brother on-line helpfiles.
When generating reports and snapshots, it may be necessary to set
this to the standard location of the help-files in order for the
help-links to work.

.IP BBNOTESSKIN
The URL prefix used for accessing the Big Brother on-line notes.
When generating reports and snapshots, it may be necessary to set
this to the standard location of the notes-files in order for the
notes-links to work.

.IP BBGENREPOPTS
Default bbgen options used by reports. This will typically include
such options as "--subpagecolumns", "--larrd", "--info" and also
"--ignorecolumns" if you wish to exclude certain tests from reports
by default.

.IP BBGENSNAPOPTS
Default bbgen options used by snapshots. This should be identical to
the options you normally used when building Big Brother webpages.

.IP BBSNAP
The location of files generated by the
.I bb-snapshot.cgi(1)
utility.

.IP BBSNAPURL
The URL prefix used to access files generated by the
.I bb-snapshot.cgi(1)
utility.

.IP FPING
Defines the location of the
.I fping(1)
program. 
.br
Default: None (uses PATH setting to find program).

.IP NSLOOKUP
Defines the location of the
.I nslookup(1)
program. 
.br
Default: None (uses PATH setting to find program).

.IP DIG
Defines the location of the
.I dig(1)
program. 
.br
Default: None (uses PATH setting to find program).

.IP NTPDATE
Defines the location of the
.I ntpdate(1)
program. 
.br
Default: None (uses PATH setting to find program).

.IP RPCINFO
Defines the location of the
.I rpcinfo(8)
program.
.br
Default: None (uses PATH setting to find program).

.IP TRACEROUTE
Defines the location of the "traceroute" tool and
any options needed to run it. traceroute it used by
the connectivity test when the ping test fails; if
requested via the "trace" tag, the TRACEROUTE command
is executed to try to determine the point in the
network that is causing the problem. By default the
command executed is "traceroute -n -q 2 -w 2 -m 15"
(no DNS lookup, max. 2 probes, wait 2 seconds per hop,
max 15 hops).
.br
If you have the
.I mtr(8)
tool installed (from http://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/) I
strongly recommend using this instead. The recommended
setting for mtr is "/usr/sbin/mtr -c 2 -n --report" (the
exact path to the mtr utility may be different on your 
system).  Note that mtr needs to be installed suid-root 
on most systems.
