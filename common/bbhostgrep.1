.TH BBHOSTGREP 1 "Version 2.12: 30 Oct 2003" "bbgen toolkit"
.SH NAME
bbhostgrep \- pick out lines in bb-hosts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bbhostgrep --help"
.br
.B "bbhostgrep --version"
.br
.B "bbhostgrep [--noextras] [--test-untagged] TAG [TAG...]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I bbhostgrep
is for use by extension scripts that need to pick out the entries 
in a bb-hosts file that are relevant to the script.

The utility accepts test names as parameters, and will then
parse the bb-hosts file and print out the host entries that
have at least one of the wanted tests specified. Tags may be
given with a trailing asterisk '*', e.g. "bbhostgrep http*"
is needed to find all http and https tags.

The bbhostgrep utility supports the use of "include" directives
inside the bb-hosts file, and will find matching tags in all
included files.

If the DOWNTIME or SLA tags are used in the
.I bb-hosts(5)
file, these are interpreted relative to the current time. 
bbhostgrep then outputs a "INSIDESLA" or "OUTSIDESLA" tag
for easier use by scripts that want to check if the current
time is inside or outside the expected uptime window.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--noextras"
Remove the "testip", "dialup", "INSIDESLA" and "OUTSIDESLA" tags 
from the output.

.IP "--test-untagged"
When using the BBLOCATION environment variable to test
only hosts on a particular network segment, bbtest-net
will ignore hosts that do not have any "NET:x" tag.
So only hosts that have a NET:$BBLOCATION tag will be
tested.
.br
With this option, hosts with no NET: tag are included
in the test, so that all hosts that either have a
matching NET: tag, or no NET: tag at all are tested.

.SH EXAMPLE
If your bb-hosts file looks like this

   192.168.1.1   www.test.com  # ftp telnet !oracle
   192.168.1.2   db1.test.com  # oracle
   192.168.1.3   mail.test.com # smtp

and you have a custom BB extension script that performs the
"oracle" test, then running "bbhostgrep oracle" would yield

   192.168.1.1   www.test.com  # !oracle
   192.168.1.2   db1.test.com  # oracle

so the script can quickly find the hosts that are of interest.

Note that the reverse-test modifier - "!oracle" - is included
in the output; this also applies to the other test modifiers
defined by BB (the dialup and always-true modifiers).

If your extension scripts use more than one tag, just list
all of the interesting tags on the command line.

bbhostgrep also supports the "NET:location" tag used by 
bbtest-net, so if your script performs network checks then 
it will see only the hosts that are relevant for the test
location that the script currently executes on.

.SH USE IN EXTENSION SCRIPTS
To integrate bbhostgrep into an existing script, look for
the line in the script that grep's in the $BBHOSTS file. 
Typically it will look somewhat like this:

   $GREP -i "^[0-9].*#.*TESTNAME" $BBHOSTS | ... code to handle test

Instead of the grep, we will use bbhostgrep. It then becomes

   $BBHOME/bin/bbhostgrep TESTNAME | ... code to handle test

which is simpler, less error-prone and more efficient.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.IP BBLOCATION
If set, bbhostgrep outputs only lines from bb-hosts that have
a matching NET:$BBLOCATION setting.
.sp
.IP BBHOSTS
Filename for the Big Brother
.I bb-hosts(5)
file.

.SH FILES
