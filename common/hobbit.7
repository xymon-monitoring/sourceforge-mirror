.TH BBGEN-INTRO 7 "Version 2.6: 24 Jul 2003" "bbgen toolkit"
.SH NAME
bbgen-intro \- introduction to the bbgen toolkit

.SH OVERVIEW
The Big Brother monitoring system - available from
BB4 Technologies at http://bb4.com/ - is a flexible
system for monitoring the health of networked systems
and services. With an easy-to-use web-based user interface
and support for a large number of the systems commonly
used today, it offers and effective framework for monitoring
your IT infrastructure to the network- and system-administrators.

Big Brother will run on anything that has the slightest
resemblance with a Unix system, due to the fact that it
is almost entirely implemented as Unix shellscripts. However,
this flexibility comes at a cost: The performance of the
Big Brother scripts is abysmal, when you need to monitor
more than just a handful of systems.

The bbgen toolkit was created to solve this problem. By
re-implementing the core functionality of the Big Brother
shell scripts in C, a huge performance boost was achieved
while maintaining compatibility with the data-files and
extension interfaces that standard Big Brother defines.
This makes it possible to drop the bbgen tools into an
existing Big Brother installation without having to change
any configuration files, and also to use the existing 
historical data collected by the standard Big Brother
tools after switching to bbgen. Should you decide to
un-install bbgen, you will be able to go back to using
the standard Big Brother tools - the bbgen tools does not
in any way change the historical monitoring data stored 
on-disk.

.SH FEATURES
The main feature of these tools is speed. My BB installation currently
has about 350 hosts, spread over 50 pages and subpages. The time
to generate the pages with the standard Big Brother web-page script
bb-display.sh was about 12 minutes. bbgen does it in less than 5 seconds.

The network test tool bbtest-net also gives significant speed improvements 
for large sites. One site reported that the runtime for their network tests 
dropped from 1000 seconds to about 30.

Apart from the performance improvements, the bbgen tools also
implement quite a few new features not found in the standard
Big Brother tools:

.IP "Unlimited subpage level"
bbgen allows you to have any tree-structure of your webpages you
may wish.

.IP "Multiple pageset support"
bbgen can generate multiple views of the same data, allowing you 
to present the hosts you monitor in different ways for different
groups of people. E.g. you can have one set of pages structured 
by customer, and another set of pages structured by support group - 
both using data for the same hosts.

.IP "Flexible on-line documentation"
bbgen can link to on-line documentation via a CGI script, allowing
you to e.g. provide access to an in-house documentation database
with the information about the hosts or services monitored.

.IP "Improved webpages"
Many small improvements to the Big Brother webpages are included
in bbgen, e.g. different icons can be used for recently changed statuses;
links to subpages can be listed in multiple columns; different icons
can be used for dialup-tests or reverse-tests; selected columns
can be dropped or unconditionally included on the webpages to
eliminate unwanted information, or always include certain information;
user-friendly names can be shown for hosts regardless of their true
hostname.

.IP "Special alerts-only webpage"
Alerts can be configured to appear on a special webpage which 
shows only active alerts. This gives your operations center
an easy to use interface for detecting problems that require
immediate attention, by eliminating all of the non-critical
issues.

.IP "LARRD support"
The LARRD trend analysis package is a popular add-on to Big Brother.
bbgen will work with the standard LARRD package - both version 
0.42 and 0.43 - and can be used to generate the HTML files used
to link the Big Brother webpages to the LARRD graphs. Which graphs
to include can also be customized on a per-host basis.

.IP "WAP support for PDAs and cell-phones"
bbgen can produce output for mobile devices such as PDA's or cell-
phones, allowing you to access information about critical systems
from this type of devices.

.IP "Service Level Agreement reporting"
bbgen can produce availability reports for use in Service Level
Agreement reporting. You can configure planned downtime, agreed
service availability level, and agreed service availability time 
and generate availability reports directly showing the actual
availability measured against the agreed SLA.

.IP "Pre-built reports"
Availability reports can be pre-generated and exported to e.g.
portal sites, so users without direct access to the Big Brother
website can view the report data.

.IP "Flexible alert reduction"
All network tests can be set not to change status to red
immediately following a failure, but to gradually go
through one or more of green -> clear -> yellow -> red.
This cuts down on the number of false alarms, if you have a
network or service that often sees brief outages, e.g.
due to load or other intermittent problems.

.IP "https websites"
bbtest-net directly supports monitoring of https-websites.

.IP "Content checking of websites"
bbtest-net supports checking not only that a website responds,
but also that certain content is found on the webpage.

.IP "SSL certificate expiration"
bbtest-net automatically checks the expiration date of SSL
certificates, and warns you when the certificate is about
to expire.

.IP "One configuration file for network tests in complex networks"
Hosts can be tagged as belonging to specific networks, allowing
you to have one configuration file for all Big Brother systems,
even when you have more than one network test engine to perform
the tests. Each network test engine will perform only the tests
relevant for the network segment, it has access to.

.IP "Flexible configuration for large sites"
The
.I bb-hosts(5)
file can be split up into smaller pieces, which the tools will
then automatically re-assemble when running tests or building
webpages.

.IP "Combination tests and dependent tests"
You can build complex tests from the simple test results already
in the Big Brother system with the
.I bbcombotest(1)
tool. Tests can also be configured to depend on other tests, 
making it easier to spot the root cause of a complex problem.

.SH THE BBGEN TOOLKIT
The tools included in the bbgen toolkit are as follows:

.I bbgen(1)
is a drop-in replacement for the bb-display.sh webpage generator
script from the Big Brother monitoring tool.  It can also replace 
part of the LARRD tool that is often used with Big Brother.

.I bbtest-net(1)
is a drop-in replacement for the bb-network.sh network 
test script in Big Brother.

.I bbretest-net.sh(1)
is a Big Brother extension script for re-doing failed
network tests with a higher frequency than the normal
network tests. This allows Big Brother to pick up a
the recovery of a network service as soon as it happens,
resulting in less downtime being recorded.

.I bbhostgrep(1)
is a utility for use by BB extension scripts. It
allows an extension script to easily pick out the hosts that
are relevant to the script, so it need not parse a huge
bb-hosts file with lots of unwanted test-specifications.

.I bbhostshow(1)
is a utility to dump the full
.I bb-hosts(5)
file following any "include" statements.

.I bbcombotest(1)
is a Big Brother extension script for the BBDISPLAY server,
allowing you to build complicated tests from simpler
BB test results. E.g. you can define a test that uses the results
from testing your webserver, DB server and router to have a 
single test showing the availability of your enterprise web
application.

.I bb-rep.cgi(1)
is a drop-in replacement for the bb-rep.sh script included in
the standard Big Brother package. This CGI program 
triggers the generation of Big Brother availability reports, 
using
.I bbgen(1)
as the reporting back-end engine.

.I bb-replog.cgi(1)
is a drop-in replacement for the bb-replog.sh script included in
the standard Big Brother package. This CGI program generates
the detailed availability report for a particular host+service
combination.

.I bb-hist.cgi(1)
is a drop-in replacement for the bb-hist.sh script included
in the standard Big Brother package. This CGI program generates
a webpage with the most recent history of a particular host+service
combination.

.I bb-snapshot.cgi(1)
is a CGI program to build the Big Brother webpages in a "snapshot"
mode, showing the look of the webpages at a particular point 
in time. It uses
.I bbgen(1)
as the back-end engine.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
What you need to install bbgen:

.IP "A Big Brother installation"
A working Big Brother installation. Get BB up and running first,
then you can drop in the bbgen tools to speed things up. The bbgen
tools are known to work with Big Brother 1.8 and 1.9 - older versions
may also work, but this has not been tested.
.br
Of course, you can install everything in one go, but it makes 
troubleshooting easier when you have only one set of programs 
to struggle with, instead of two.

.IP fping
For network connectivity tests, the fping utility must be 
installed. This tool is available from www.fping.org.

.IP libcurl
The network test tools use the "curl" library, available from 
http://curl.haxx.se/
.br
Many Linux distributions include curl as part of the standard
software - make sure you have the development files installed
as well. You should use version 7.9.8 or later of the library,
as some features needed by bbtest-net are not available in earlier
versions.

.IP openssl
The OpenSSL library is used by libcurl for checking https websites,
and should be installed before you install libcurl. If your
system does not already have openssl installed, you can pick it
up from http://www.openssl.org/


.SH COMPATIBILITY
The bbgen toolkit is intended to be a drop-in replacement 
for the tools in Big Brother version 1.9c, with the following 
exceptions:

.IP "group directive"
A "group" directive in the 
.I bb-hosts(5)
file is treated as a "group-compress".

.IP "dialup directive"
The "dialup" directive in standard Big Brother allows
you to test a modem-bank by pinging a range of IP-adresses.
This feature is not implemented in the bbgen toolkit.
.br
Note: This only applies to the entries in bb-hosts that
*begin* with the "dialup" keyword, and is used to test
a range of IP-adresses. The "dialup" flag on a host is
implemented, as is the "?" modifier on a network test that 
flags it as a "dialup" service, i.e. a service that may
be down without generating an alert.

.IP ":q and :Q modifiers"
The ":q" and ":Q" modifiers on individual tests are ignored.
These modifiers are only relevant for the standard Big 
Brother network test tool bbnet, which is not used when
you install the bbgen network test tools.

.IP "Hosts not in bb-hosts are ignored"
Standard Big Brother will process status-logs from unknown
hosts, and these can cause the web pages to have a purple
background color. The bbgen toolkit ignores logs from hosts
not listed in the bb-hosts file.
