.TH BBTASKS.CFG 5 "Version 3.4: 21 nov 2004" "bbgen toolkit"
.SH NAME
bbtasks.cfg \- Task definitions for the bblaunch utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "Defines the tasks in the Big Brother system, run by bblaunch"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The bbtasks.cfg file holds the list of tasks that bblaunch runs 
to perform all of the tasks needed by the Big Brother monitor.

.SH FILE FORMAT
A task is defined by a \fBkey\fR, a \fBcommand\fR, and optionally 
also \fBinterval\fR, \fBenvironment\fR, and \fBlogfile\fR.

An entry looks like this:
.sp
    [bbgend]
.br
          CMD /usr/local/bb/bb/bin/bbgend
.sp
    [bbdisplay]
.br
          CMD /usr/local/bb/bb/bin/bbgen --info --larrd043
.br
          NEEDS bbgend
.br
          GROUP webupdates
.br
          INTERVAL 5m
.br
          ENVFILE /usr/local/bb/bb/etc/bbserver.env
.br
          LOGFILE /var/log/bb/bbdisplay.log
.sp
The \fBkey\fR is enclosed in angle brackets, and must be unique
for each task. You can choose your key-names as you like, they
are only used internally in bblaunch to identify each task.

The \fBcommand\fR is defined by the \fbCMD\fR keyword. This is
the full command including any options you want to use for this 
task. This is required for all tasks.

The \fBNEEDS\fR instructs bblaunch not to run this task unless
the task defined by the NEEDS keyword is already running. This
is used e.g. to delay the start of some application until the
needed daemons have been started. The task that must be running
is defined by its \fBkey\fR.

The \fBGROUP\fR keyword can be used to limit the number of tasks 
that may run simultaneously. E.g. if you are generating multiple
pagesets of webpages, you dont want them to run at the same time.
Putting them into a GROUP will cause bblaunch to delay the start
of new tasks, so that only one task will run per group. You can
change the limit by defining the group before the tasks, with
a "GROUP groupname maxtasks" line.

The \fBINTERVAL\fR keyword defines how often this command is
executed. The example shows a command that runs every 5 minutes.
If no interval is given, the task is only run once - this is
useful for tasks that run continually as daemons - although
if the task stops for some reason, then bblaunch will attempt
to restart it. Intervals can be specified in seconds (if you 
just put a number there), or in minutes (5m), hours (2h), or
days (1d).

The \fBENVFILE\fR setting points to a file with definitions of
environment variables. Before running the task, bblaunch will
setup all of the environment variables listed in this file.
Since this is a per-task setting, you can use the same bblaunch
instance to run e.g. both the server- and client-side BB 
tasks. If this option is not present, then the environment 
defined to bblaunch is used.

The \fBLOGFILE\fR setting defines a logfile for the task.
bblaunch will start the task with stdout and stderr redirected
to this file. If this option is not present, then the output
goes to the same location as the bblaunch output.
