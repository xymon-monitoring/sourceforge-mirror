This directory contains a program developed at the Stanford Exploration
Project, Geophysics Department, by Kamal Al-Yahya.  It was modified and
enhanced substantially by Christian Engel at the Rheinisch-Westfaelische
Technische Hochschule at Aachen, Germany, Department of Computer Science 4.
Copying the sources and the program to any other machine is permitted
without prior permission provided that copyright messages are kept, no
profit is made by copying the files, and modifications are clearly
documented.

I would very much appreciate any comments or suggestions. My e-net

It seems as if Kamal isn't to the net anymore.

I have made several modifications on Kamal's version 0.93 from the net.
Thus I continued my revision numbering with 1.00. The actual revision is
version 2.2 1992/04/27 15:13:26.

			USING THE TRANSLATOR

You can run the program either by
		tr2latex < file  > file.tex
or
		tr2latex file  > file.tex
You are most likely to get messages on the standard error telling
you about things it encounters and cannot do.

Now you have the translated document. Look at it and see if you
can spot a major error. Run it through latex. If it runs and produces
the dvi file, then print it. If you get latex error messages modify
the translated document accordingly and repeat the latex run, and so on.
I usually get away with one or two iterations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

And in 2009 it seems as if Christian Engel has vanished from the
Internet as well, so I have took over this project and updated the
build process for a modern UN*X system.
