Build file for BBWin
==============================================================

This file explains you how to build BBWin from the sources.


Getting the last sources 
========================

BBWin is developped in C++ (the Standard Template Library and the Standard C++ Library
are used)
The source of BBWin are available from the sourceforge subversion
repository for the BBWin projects :
http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/bbwin/


Install the tools
=================

BBWin has been developped thanks to many tools. You should install them to 
build BBWin easily without troubles.

Windows Platform SDK 2003 : it is used for the development environment.
It is use to have the complete sdk to develop programs on Microsoft OS.
You can download it for free from microsoft website :
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A55B6B43-E24F-4EA3-A93E-40C0EC4F68E5&displaylang=en
You will need 1 gb of free space if you install every thing :)
BBWin Makefiles are using the nmake tool and Makefile templates from the SDK.
This SDK is very important for anyone who would like to start developping under Windows.

Visual C++ Toolkit : it is the compiler used to build the bbwin release
It is the original compiler from Visual Studio 2003 Professional (Code optimisation is included)
You can download it for free from the Microsoft website :
http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/

Wix Toolkit : this package is used to build the BBWin MSI installer
You should install it and have the bin directory in your current path
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/

TinyXML : BBWin used the excellent TinyXML library for the configuration loading XML.
You do not need to install it. TinyXML sources are included in BBWin sources.

Boost Lib : These powerful C++ libraries are used for some agents and will be
certainly used in the BBWin core service in the future.
You should get the boost C++ from the website : 
http://www.boost.org/
Build it in the directory C:\boost so you won't have to change BBWin Makefiles.
If you want to build BBWin with Visual C++ Express 2005, please read the following page :
http://www.boost.org/tools/build/v1/vc-8_0-tools.html


I recommand you the Notepad++ editor if you are looking for a nice free code editor.
You can download it from : 
http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net



Building the BBWin with Visual C++ Express 2005
===============================================

Open the BBWin.sln file at the top directory of the project
First, you should prepare your Visual C++ configuration by adding
in the default bin, include and lib directories the different directories from :

- the platform SDK
- the boost libraries

Then just build the solution.


Building the BBWin with Visual C++ ToolKit 2003
===============================================

Open a Platform SDK Build command line environment (installed with the Platform SDK)
Go the top directory of the BBWin source tree
Type nmake
Go get a cup of coffee
It's ready !

If you get errors, it may be due to some errors in your include or lib path.
Make sure the environment variables %Lib%; %Path% and %Include% are correctly 
configured. You may need to add some directories.

Building process order
======================

1) BBWin core service
2) Agents
3) Externals (needing compilation)
4) Setup MSI
