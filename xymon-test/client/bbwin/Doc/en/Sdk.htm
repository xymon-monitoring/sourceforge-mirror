 <H1>Agent SDK</H1>
<H3>Description</H3>
<p>
BBWin is using agents to monitor the different parts of the operating system. However, you may need 
add probes to improve the monitoring of your servers. For that, you can create externals scripts to extend
the possibilities. However, BBWin provide an agent SDK so you can create native BBWin agents.
</p>
<p>
The sdk is not installed by default but is present in the Windows Installer package. 
BBWin is developped in C++ so agents are also written in C++. 
</p>
<p>
The sdk consists of :
<UL>
<LI>the headers that you need to compile your BBWin agent
<LI>a readme file that explain how to develop your own agent
<LI>an example of agent called "sample"
</UL>
