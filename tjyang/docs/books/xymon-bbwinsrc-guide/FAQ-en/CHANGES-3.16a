Changes in version 3.16a

Revised answers:
  Label filename: extend macro definitions, hopefully expanding the
                  usefulness and usability of the answer

Bugfixes:
  Label cmdstar: part of the example code was just wrong
  Label enumerate: unclarity in text caused by a typo
  Bug in "introduction=yes" code corrected

Future releases:
  I'm still aiming for (approximately) monthly "bugfix" releases.
  There are no current plans for a major release.
