\section{Updates to the FAQ}

The list of frequently-asked questions that was published as
Baskerville volume~4, number~6, should be maintained if it's to retain
its usefulness.

While I can do at least some of this for myself, I would welcome
comments on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Questions that weren't ansswered in the original, but should
  have been, and
\item Errors in the original.
\end{itemize}

To kick the ball off, here's one of each type.

New question: Typesetting a degree sign in \LaTeXe{}.

Answer: The following macro will do the job

|  \newcommand{\degree}[1][]{\ensuremath{{#1}^\circ}}|

Errata in the original:

The question on ``getting \MF{} to do what you want'' refers you to the
CTAN file~|documentation/metafont_for_beginners.tex|; the file is in
fact~|info/metafont-for-beginners.tex|

The question on ``Mailing lists about \TeX{} and its friends'' has two
errors in it.

\begin{itemize}
\item The UK\TeX{} list has now ceased publication, and its content
      has now been taken over by the \TeX{}hax list.
\item The description of the |ctt-digest| and |info-tex| lists, and
      their relation to the newsgroup |comp.text.tex| is confusing.
      |info-tex| does \emph{not} receive postings to |comp.text.tex|,
      and therefore the content of |ctt-digest| will typically contain
      much material that isn't present in |info-tex|.  However,
      messages mailed to |info-tex| appear in |comp.text.tex|, and
      therefore (ultimately) appear in |ctt-digest|.
\end{itemize}

Thanks to Allan Reese and Barbara Beeton for pointing me towards these
problems.
