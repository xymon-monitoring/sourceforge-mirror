Presentation:
  LaTeX ``...'' quotes in the source used to be converted to the ascii
  double-quote character in the HTML; this is changed to use the HTML
  entities for "typographic" quotes (similarly for single quotes and
  apostrophes).

  A minor change to html generation has been made, inserting paragraph
  elements after block quotes: this makes CSS-controlled display more
  regular (a CSS sheet is used in the code generated for the new CGI
  engine -- see below).

  Building the FAQ now requires e-TeX (or rather [pdf-]e-LaTeX); this
  should not be a problem unless your TeX distribution is a bit aged.

Future releases:
  This release is wildly overdue (even making allowance for my
  extended illness).  If I can find the time to do so, I intend in
  future to release anything that's available, around the end of each
  month.  Full releases, with batches of new questions, may still be
  long delayed, but I hope not.

Coming up (still):
  I have a far more efficient CGI engine for serving answers to the web;
  those of a strong constitution may view the experimental testbed at:
    URL http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html-gamma
  It is missing a search engine, various links and topping and tailing
  of answers; it uses Cambridge University's "default" CSS sheet in a
  non-standard way; and, crucially it lacks **SUPPORT**.  I welcome
  suggestions for improving the way I do things, but I can't claim it
  will always work.

  Mechanisms whereby I can point to the CTAN catalogue from FAQ
  answers remains as a "background task"; I suggested several ways
  (last time) in which such links would be valuable.
