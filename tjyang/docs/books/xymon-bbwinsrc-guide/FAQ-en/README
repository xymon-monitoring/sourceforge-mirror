			    The UK TeX FAQ

1. Origins and maintenance

This FAQ was started as a committee effort by the UK TeX Users' Group.

If you wish to offer help, or to comment on the content of the FAQ,
please mail faq-devel@tex.ac.uk

2. Licence

The source of the FAQ itself and its derived products (human-readable
versions presented as DVI, PostScript, Adobe Acrobat and HTML) are
placed in the public domain.

You are permitted (nay, encouraged) to distribute the FAQ as widely as
you like.  Please be careful to keep your copy of the FAQ up-to-date:
it's possible to mirror the FAQ's directory on CTAN, or to watch the
CTAN announcements mailing list (see the "answer" on mailing lists in
the FAQ itself).

Further, you are urged to be very careful about modifying the FAQ:

- the source and its relationship to the macros that support it, and
  to the dubious Perl scripts that create HTML versions, is extremely
  fragile; so changes are likely to be tricky to "get right"

- there's a positive danger in publishing un-reviewed advice,
  particularly if it claims to come from a usually reliable source.

Therefore, if you do have changes to make, please consider submitting
them to faq-devel@tex.ac.uk at least in parallel with making changes
to your own copy.  A statement that details what you've done, in your
copy of the FAQ, is particularly useful.
