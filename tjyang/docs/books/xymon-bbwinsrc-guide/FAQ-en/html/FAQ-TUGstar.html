<h3>TeX User Groups</h3>
<p>There has been a TeX User Group since very near the time TeX
first appeared.  That first group, TUG, is still active and its
journal <i>TUGboat</i> continues in regular publication
with articles about TeX, Metafont and related technologies, and about
document design, processing and production.  TUG holds a yearly
conference, whose proceedings are published in <i>TUGboat</i>.
<p>TUG&rsquo;s web site is a valuable resource for all sorts of
TeX-related matters, such as details of TeX software, and lists
of TeX vendors and TeX consultants.  Back articles from
<i>TUGboat</i> are slowly (subject to copyright issues, etc.)
making their way to the site, too.
<p>Some time ago, TUG established a &ldquo;technical council&rdquo;, whose
task was to oversee the development of TeXnical projects.  Most
such projects nowadays go on their way without any support from
TUG, but TUG&rsquo;s web site lists its

<a href="http://www.tug.org/twg.html">Technical Working Groups (TWGs)</a>.
<p>TUG has a reasonable claim to be considered a world-wide
organisation, but there are many national and regional user groups,
too; TUG&rsquo;s web site maintains a list of

<a href="http://www.tug.org/lugs.html">&ldquo;local user groups&rdquo; (LUGs)</a>.
