<h3>The ANT typesetting system</h3>
<p>Achim Blumensath&rsquo;s <a href="http://ant.berlios.de">ANT</a> project,
in contrast to <i>NTS</i>, aims
not to replicate TeX with a different implementation technique, but
rather to provide a replacement for TeX which uses TeX-like
typesetting algorithms in a very different programming environment.
ANT remains under development, but it is now approaching the
status of a usable typesetting system.
<p>ANT&rsquo;s markup language is immediately recognisable to the
(La)TeX user, but the scheme of implementing design in
ANT&rsquo;s own implementation language (presently
<i>OCaml</i>) comes as a pleasant surprise to the jaded FAQ
writer.  This architecture holds the promise of a system that avoids a
set of serious problems with TeX&rsquo;s user interface: those that
derive from the design language being the same as the markup language.
