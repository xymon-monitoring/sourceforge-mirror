<h3>Weird characters in <i>dvips</i> output</h3>
<!-- fi ligature pound pounds sterling elephants -->
<p>You&rsquo;ve innocently generated output, using <i>dvips</i>, and there
are weird transpositions in it: for example, the <code>fi</code> ligature has
appeared as a textsterling symbol.
This is an unwanted side-effect of the precautions
outlined in <a href="FAQ-dvips-pdf.html">generating PostScript for PDF</a>.
The <code>-G1</code> switch discussed in that question is appropriate for
Knuth&rsquo;s text fonts, but doesn&rsquo;t work with text fonts that don&rsquo;t follow
Knuth&rsquo;s patterns (such as fonts supplied by Adobe).
<p>If the problem arises, suppress the <code>-G1</code> switch: if you were using it
explicitly, <em>don&rsquo;t</em>; if you were using <code>-Ppdf</code>, add <code>-G0</code> to
suppress the implicit switch in the pseudo-printer file.
<p>The problem has been corrected in <i>dvips</i> v 5.90 (and later
versions), which should be available in any recent TeX distribution.
