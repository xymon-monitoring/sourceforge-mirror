<h3>Preventing hyphenation of a particular word</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite possible for (<em>any</em>) hyphenation of a particular word
to seem &ldquo;completely wrong&rdquo;, so that you want to prevent it being
hyphenated.
<p>If the word occurs in just one place, put it in a box:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\mbox{oddword}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
(Plain TeX users should use <code>\</code><code>hbox</code>, and take care at the start
of paragraphs.)  However, boxing the word is not really advisable
unless you are sure it only occurs once.
<p>If the word occurs commonly, the best choice is to assert a
non-hyphenation for it:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\hyphenation{oddword}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
This hyphenation exception (with no break points) will be used in
preference to what TeX&rsquo;s hyphenation algorithm may come up with.
<p>In a multilingual document, repeat the exception specification for
each language the word may appear in.  So:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\usepackage[french,english]{babel}
\selectlanguage{english}
\hyphenation{oddword}
\selectlanguage{french}
\hyphenation{oddword}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
(note that <i>babel</i> will select the default language for the
document &mdash; English, in this case &mdash; at <code>\</code><code>begin{document}</code>.)
