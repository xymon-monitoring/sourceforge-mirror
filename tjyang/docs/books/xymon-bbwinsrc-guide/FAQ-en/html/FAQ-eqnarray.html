<h3>Why not use <code>eqnarray</code>?</h3>
<p>The environment <code>eqnarray</code> is attractive for the
occasional user of mathematics in LaTeX documents: it seems to
allow aligned systems of equations.  Indeed it <em>does</em> supply such
things, but it makes a serious mess of spacing.  In the system:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{eqnarray}
  a & = & b + c \\
  x & = & y - z
\end{eqnarray}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
the spacing around the &ldquo;=&rdquo; signs is <em>not</em> that defined in the
metrics for the font from which the glyph comes &mdash; it&rsquo;s
<code>\</code><code>arraycolsep</code>, which may be set to some very odd value for reasons
associated with real arrays elsewhere in the document.
<p>The user is far better served by the AMSLaTeX bundle, which
provides an <code>align</code> environment, which is designed with
the needs of mathematicians in mind (as opposed to the convenience of
LaTeX programmers).  For this simple case (align is capable of far
greater things), code as:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{align}
  a & = b + c \\
  x & = y - z
\end{align}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
