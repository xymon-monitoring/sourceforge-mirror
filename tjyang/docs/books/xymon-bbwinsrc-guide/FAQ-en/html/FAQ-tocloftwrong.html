<h3>Numbers too large in table of contents, etc.</h3>
<p>LaTeX constructs the table of contents, list of figures, tables,
and similar tables, on the basis of a layout specified in the class.
As a result, they do <em>not</em> react to the sizes of things in them,
as they would if a <code>tabular</code> environment (or something
similar) was used.
<p>This arrangement can provoke problems, most commonly with deep section
nesting or very large page numbers: the numbers in question just don&rsquo;t
fit in the space allowed for them in the class.
<p>A separate answer discusses 
 
<a href="FAQ-tocloft.html">re-designing the tables</a>
and those techniques can be employed to make the numbers fit.
