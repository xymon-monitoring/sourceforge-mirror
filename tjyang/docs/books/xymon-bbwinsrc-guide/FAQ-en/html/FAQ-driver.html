<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question label driver</title>
</head><body>
<h3>What is a driver?</h3>
<p>A driver is a program that takes as input a DVI file
(<a href="FAQ-dvi.html">DVI files</a>)  and
(usually) produces a file that can be sent to a typographic
output device, called a printer for short.
<p>A driver will usually be specific to a particular printer,
although any PostScript printer ought to be able to print
the output from a PostScript driver.

<p>As well as the DVI file, the driver needs font information.
Font information may be held as bitmaps or as outlines, or simply as a
set of pointers into the fonts that the printer itself &lsquo;has&rsquo;.
Each driver will expect the font information in
a particular form.  For more information on the forms of fonts,
see <a href="FAQ-pk.html">PK files</a>,
