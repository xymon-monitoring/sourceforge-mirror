<h3>What is ConTeXt?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.pragma-ade.com/">ConTeXt</a> is a macro package
developed by Hans Hagen, originally to
serve the needs of his (Dutch) firm Pragma.  It was designed with the
same general-purpose aims as LaTeX, but (being younger) reflects
much more recent thinking about the structure of markup, etc.  In
particular, ConTeXt can customise its markup to an
author&rsquo;s language (customising modules for Dutch, English and German
are provided, at present).
<p>ConTeXt is well integrated, in all of its structure,
with the needs of hypertext markup, and in particular with the
facilities offered by <a href="FAQ-whatpdftex.html">PDFTeX</a>.
The default installation employs a version of PDFTeX built with the
<a href="FAQ-etex.html">e-TeX extensions</a>, which allows further flexibility.
<p>ConTeXt doesn&rsquo;t yet have quite such a large developer community as
does LaTeX, but those developers who are active seem to have
prodigious energy.  Some support is available via a 
<a href="http://contextgarden.net/">WIKI site</a>.
