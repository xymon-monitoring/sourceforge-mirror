<h3>WIKI pages for TeX and friends</h3>
<p>The <em>WIKI</em> concept can be a boon to everyone, if used sensibly.
The &ldquo;general&rdquo; WIKI allows <em>anyone</em> to add stuff, or to edit
stuff that someone else has added: while there is obvious potential
for chaos, there is evidence that a strong user community can keep a
WIKI under control.
<p>Following the encouraging performance of the 
<a href="http://contextgarden.net/">ConTeXt WIKI</a>, both a
<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/TeX">(Plain) TeX WIKI</a> and a
<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX WIKI</a> have been
established.  Both seem rather sparse, as yet, and the LaTeX WIKI
contains some suggestions that go counter to established advice (e.g.,
the LaTeX WIKI has details on the 
<a href="FAQ-eqnarray.html">use of the <code>eqnarray</code> environment</a>);
however one may hope that both will become useful resources in the
longer term.
