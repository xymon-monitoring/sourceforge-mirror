<h3>Setting text ragged right</h3>
<p>The trick with typesetting ragged right is to be sure you&rsquo;ve told the
TeX engine &ldquo;make this paragraph ragged, but never <em>too</em>
ragged&rdquo;.  The LaTeX <code>\</code><code>raggedright</code> command (and the
corresponding <code>flushleft</code> environment) has a tendency to
miss the &ldquo;never&rdquo; part, and will often create ridiculously short
lines, for some minor benefit later in the paragraph.  The Plain
TeX version of the command doesn&rsquo;t suffer this failing, but is
rather conservative: it is loath to create too large a gap at the end
of the line, but in some circumstances (such as where


<a href="FAQ-hyphoff.html">hyphenation is suppressed</a>) painfully large gaps may
sometimes be required.
<p>Martin Schr&ouml;der&rsquo;s <i>ragged2e</i> package offers the best of both
worlds: it provides raggedness which is built on the Plain TeX
model, but which is easily configurable.  It defines easily-remembered
command (e.g., <code>\</code><code>RaggedRight</code>) and environment (e.g.,
<code>FlushLeft</code>) names that are simply capitalised
transformations of the LaTeX kernel originals.  The documentation
discusses the issues and explains the signficance of the various
parameters of <i>ragged2e</i>&rsquo;s operation.
