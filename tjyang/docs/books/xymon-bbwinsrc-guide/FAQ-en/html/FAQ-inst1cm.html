<h3>Installing the Bluesky versions of the CM fonts</h3>
<p>This is a specialised case of <a href="FAQ-instfont.html">installing a font</a>,
but it comes easier
than most, since the font metrics are installed in every (La)TeX
system before you even start.  Indeed, most recent systems will have
the Type 1 fonts themselves already installed, so that the job is
already done, and all you need is to start using them:
so the first thing to do is to just try it.  On a system that uses
<i>dvips</i> (most systems nowadays do), try the sequence:
<pre>
  latex sample2e
  dvips -Pcmz -Pamz -o sample2e.ps sample2e
</pre>
at a &ldquo;command prompt&rdquo; (<i>shell</i>, in a Unix-style system,
&ldquo;DOS box&rdquo; in a Windows system).
<p>If the command works at all, the console output of the command will
include a sequence of Type 1 font file names, listed as
<code>&lt;cmr10.pfb&gt;</code> and so on;
this is <i>dvips</i> telling you it&rsquo;s including the Type 1 font,
and you need do no more.
<p>If the test has failed, you need to install your own set of the fonts.
<p>The CTAN directories listed below contain compressed archives of
the Type 1 
files for various architectures, both for the Computer Modern fonts
and for the AMS fonts of mathematical and other useful things.
Download the archives that are appropriate for your architecture, and
extract the files &mdash; you only actually need the contents of the
<i>pfb</i> directories, since you already have the fonts
installed in the &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; way, so that the TFM files are
already present.  (You don&rsquo;t need the PostScript font metric &mdash; AFM
and PFM &mdash; files in any case.)
<p>The files should go into your local <code>texmf</code> tree (<i>texmf.local</i>,
<i>texmf-local</i>, <i>localtexmf</i>, or whatever).  Create
directories at offsets <i>fonts/type1/bluesky/cm</i> and
<i>fonts/type1/bluesky/ams</i>, and copy the <code>pfb</code> files into them.
<p>Now you need to tell <i>dvips</i>, PDFTeX, etc., that the fonts
are available.  This is done by use of a <em>map file</em>, which lists
<em>font name</em> (as TeX understands it), <em>font name</em> (as it
appears in the type 1 file itself), and where the program will find
the file.  Map files are provided in the download bundles for the
AMS fonts; for the CM fonts, map files are available
separately.
<p>The set of map files includes files <code>config.*</code>; each of these contains
an instruction to load a single map file.  For ordinary use, you
instruct <i>dvips</i> to load the &ldquo;detailed&rdquo; map of the
CM fonts by use of the command:
<pre>
  dvips -Pcmz myfile
</pre>
The same can be done with the AMS fonts, and you may invoke
both sets of fonts with:
<pre>
  dvips -Pcmz -Pamz myfile
</pre>
Alternatively, the contents of <i>config.cmz</i> and <i>config.amz</i>
could be combined into a single file, perhaps <i>config.bluesky</i>,
loaded by the command
<pre>
  dvips -Pbluesky myfile
</pre>
<p>Remember, after all such changes, the 
<a href="FAQ-instpackages.html">file-name database must be refreshed</a>.
