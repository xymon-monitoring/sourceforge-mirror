<h3>How should I pronounce &ldquo;LaTeX(2e)&rdquo;?</h3>

<p>Lamport never recommended how one should pronounce LaTeX, but a lot
of people pronounce it &lsquo;Lay TeX&rsquo; or perhaps &lsquo;Lah TeX&rsquo; (with
TeX pronounced as the program itself; see
<a href="FAQ-TeXpronounce.html">the rules for TeX</a>).  It is definitely
<em>not</em> to be pronounced in the same way as the rubber-tree gum.
<p>The &lsquo;epsilon&rsquo; in &lsquo;LaTeX2e&rsquo; is supposed to be suggestive of a small
improvement over the old LaTeX 2.09.  Nevertheless, most people
pronounce the name as &lsquo;LaTeX-two-ee&rsquo;.
