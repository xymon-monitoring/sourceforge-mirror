<h3>Installing a PostScript printer built-in font</h3>
<p>There is a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; set of fonts that has appeared in every PostScript
printer since the second generation of the type.  These fonts
(8 families of four text fonts each, and three special-purpose fonts)
are of course widely used, because of their simple availability.  The
set consists of:
<ul>
<li> <i>Times</i> family (4 fonts)
<li> <i>Palatino</i> family (4 fonts)
<li> <i>New</i> <i>Century</i> <i>Schoolbook</i> family (4 fonts)
<li> <i>Bookman</i> family (4 fonts)
<li> <i>Helvetica</i> family (4 fonts)
<li> <i>Avant</i> <i>Garde</i> (4 fonts)
<li> <i>Courier</i> family (4 fonts)
<li> <i>Utopia</i> family (4 fonts)
<li> Zapf <i>Chancery</i> (1 font)
<li> Zapf <i>Dingbats</i> (1 font)
<li> <i>Symbol</i> (1 font)
</ul>
All these fonts are supported, for LaTeX users, by the
<i>psnfss</i> set of metrics and support files in the file
<i>lw35nfss.zip</i> on CTAN.  Almost any remotely modern TeX
system will have some version of <i>psnfss</i> installed, but
users should note that the most recent version has much improved
coverage of maths-with-<i>Times</i> and -<i>Palatino</i>, as
well as a more reliable set of font metrics.
<p>The archive <i>lw35nfss.zip</i> is laid out according to the
TDS, so in principle, installation consists simply of
&ldquo;unzipping&rdquo; the file at the root of a <i>texmf</i> tree.
<p>Documentation of the <i>psnfss</i> bundle is provided in
<i>psnfss2e.pdf</i> in the distribution.
