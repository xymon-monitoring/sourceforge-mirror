<h3>Table of contents rearranges &ldquo;<i>unsrt</i>&rdquo; ordering</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using the <i>unsrt</i> bibliography style, you&rsquo;re
expecting that your bibliography will <em>not</em> be sorted, but that
the entries will appear in the order that they first appeared in your
document.
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re unfortunate enough to need a citation in a section
title, and you also have a table of contents, the citations that now
appear in the table of contents will upset the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; ordering
produced by the <i>unsrt</i> style.  Similarly, if you have
citations in captions, and have a list of figures (or tables).
<p>There&rsquo;s a pretty simple &ldquo;manual&rdquo; method for dealing with the
problem &mdash; when you have the document stable:
<ol>
<li> Delete the <code>.aux</code> file, and any of <code>.toc</code>,
  <code>.lof</code>, <code>.lot</code> files.
<li> Run LaTeX.
<li> Run BibTeX for the last time.
<li> Run LaTeX often enough that things are stable again.
</ol>
Which is indeed simple, but it&rsquo;s going to get tedious when you&rsquo;ve
found errors in your &ldquo;stable&rdquo; version, often enough.
<p>The package <i>notoccite</i> avoids the kerfuffle, and suppresses
citations while in the table of contents, or lists of figures, tables
(or other floating things: the code is quite general).
