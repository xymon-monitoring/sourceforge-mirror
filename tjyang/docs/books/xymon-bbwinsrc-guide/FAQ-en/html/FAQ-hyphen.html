<h3>How does hyphenation work in TeX?</h3>
<p>Everyone knows what hyphenation is: we see it in most books we read,
and (if we&rsquo;re alert) often spot ridiculous mis-hyphenation from time
to time (at one time, British newspapers were a fertile source).
<p>Hyphenation styles are culturally-determined, and the same language
may be hyphenated differently in different countries &mdash; for example,
British and American styles of hyphenation of English are very
different.  As a result, a typesetting system that is not restricted
to a single language at a single locale needs to be able to change its
hyphenation rules from time to time.
<p>TeX uses a pretty good system for hyphenation (originally designed
by Frank Liang), and while it&rsquo;s capable of missing &ldquo;sensible&rdquo;
hyphenation points, it seldom selects grossly wrong ones.  The
algorithm matches candidates for hyphenation against a set of
&ldquo;hyphenation patterns&rdquo;.  The candidates for hyphenation must be
sequences of letters (or other single characters that TeX may be
persuaded to think of as letters) &mdash; things such as TeX&rsquo;s
<code>\</code><code>accent</code> primitive interrupt hyphenation.
<p>Sets of hyphenation patterns are usually derived from analysis of
a list of valid hyphenations (the process of derivation, using a tool
called <i>patgen</i>, is not ordinarily a participatory sport).
<p>The patterns for the languages a TeX system is going to deal with
may only be loaded when the system is installed.  To change the set of
languages, a <a href="FAQ-newlang.html">partial reinstallation</a> is necessary.
<p>TeX provides two &ldquo;user-level&rdquo; commands for control of
hyphenation: <code>\</code><code>language</code> (which selects a hyphenation style), and
<code>\</code><code>hyphenation</code> (which gives explicit instructions to the hyphenation
engine, overriding the effect of the patterns).
<p>The ordinary LaTeX user need not worry about <code>\</code><code>language</code>, since
it is very thoroughly managed by the <i>babel</i> package; use of
<code>\</code><code>hyphenation</code> is discussed in

<a href="FAQ-nohyph.html">hyphenation failure</a>.
