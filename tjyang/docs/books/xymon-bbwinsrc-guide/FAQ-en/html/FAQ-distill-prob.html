<h3>Characters missing from PDF output</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using <i>Acrobat</i> <i>Distiller</i> to create your
PDF output, you may find
characters missing.  This may manifest
itself as messed-up maths equations (missing
&ldquo;-&rdquo; signs, for example), or bits missing
from large symbols.  Early versions of <i>Distiller</i> used to
ignore character positions 0&ndash;31 and 128&ndash;159 of every font: Adobe&rsquo;s
fonts never use such positions, so why should <i>Distiller</i>?
<p>Well, the answer to this question is &ldquo;because Adobe don&rsquo;t produce all
the world&rsquo;s fonts&rdquo; &mdash; fonts like <i>Computer</i>
<i>Modern</i> were around before Adobe came on the scene, and
<em>they</em> use positions 0&ndash;31.  Adobe don&rsquo;t react to complaints like
that in the previous sentence, but they do release new versions of
their programs; and <i>Distiller</i>, since at least version 4.0,
<em>has</em> recognised the font positions it used to shun.
<p>Meanwhile, TeX users with old versions of <i>Distiller</i> need
to deal with their fonts.  <i>Dvips</i> comes to our aid: the
switch <code>-G1</code> (&ldquo;remap characters&rdquo;), which moves the offending
characters out of the way.  The PDF configuration file
(<code>-Ppdf</code>), recommended 
in &ldquo;<a href="FAQ-fuzzy-type3.html">the wrong type of fonts</a>&rdquo;,
includes the switch.
<p>The switch is not without its problems; pre-2003 versions of
<i>dvips</i> will apply it to Adobe fonts as well, causing
<a href="FAQ-charshift.html">havoc</a>, but fortunately
that problem is usually soluble.  However, a document using both
CM and Adobe-specified fonts is stuck.  The only real solution
is either to upgrade <i>dvips</i>, or to spend money to upgrade
<i>Distiller</i>.
