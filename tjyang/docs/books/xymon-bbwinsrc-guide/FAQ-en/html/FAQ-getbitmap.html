<h3>Acquiring bitmap fonts</h3>
<p>When CTAN was young, most people would start using TeX
with a 300 dots-per-inch (dpi) laser printer, and sets of Computer
Modern bitmap fonts for this resolution are available on CTAN.
(There are separate sets for write-black and write-white printers, as
well as sets at 120 dpi and 240 dpi.)
<p>Over the years, there have been regular requests that CTAN should hold
a wider range of resolutions, but they were resisted for two reasons:
<ul>
<li> The need to decide which printers to generate fonts for.  The
  broad-brush approach taken for 300 dpi printers was (more or less)
  justified back then, given the dominance of certain printer
  &lsquo;engines&rsquo;, but nowadays one could not make any such assumption.
<li> Given the above, justifying the space taken up by a huge array
  of bitmap fonts.
</ul>
Fortunately, (La)TeX distribution technology has put a stop to these
arguments: most (if not all) current distributions generate bitmap
fonts as needed, and cache them for later re-use.  The impatient
user, who is determined that all bitmap fonts should be created once
and for all, may be supported by scripts such as <i>allcm</i>
(distributed with teTeX, at least; otherwise such a person should
consult <a href="FAQ-useMF.html">"the use of Metafont"</a>).
<p>If your output is to a PostScript-capable device, you advised to switch to
using Type 1 versions of the CM fonts.  Two free
sets are currently available; the older (<i>bakoma</i>) is
somewhat less well produced than the <i>bluesky</i> fonts, which were
originally professionally produced and sold, but were then donated to
the public domain by their originators Y&amp;Y and Bluesky Research,
in association with the AMS.  Unfortunately, the coverage of
the sets is slightly different, but you are advised to use the
<i>bluesky</i> set except when <i>bakoma</i> is for some reason
absolutely unavoidable.  In recent years, several other &lsquo;Metafont&rsquo; fonts
have been converted to Type 1 format; it&rsquo;s common never to need to
generate bitmap fonts for any purpose other than previewing (see

<a href="FAQ-PSpreview.html">&ldquo;previewing documents with Type 1 fonts&rdquo;</a>).
