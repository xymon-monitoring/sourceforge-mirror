<h3>What are PK files?</h3>
<p>PK files (packed raster) contain font bitmaps. The output
from

  <a href="FAQ-useMF.html">Metafont</a>
includes a generic font (GF) file and the
utility <i>gftopk</i> produces the PK file from that.
There are a lot of PK files, as one is needed for each font,
that is each magnification (size) of each design (point) size for each
weight for each family.  Further, since the PK files for one printer
do not necessarily work well for another, the whole set needs to be
duplicated for each printer type at a site.  As a result, they are
often held in an elaborate directory structure, or in &lsquo;font library
files&rsquo;, to regularise access.
