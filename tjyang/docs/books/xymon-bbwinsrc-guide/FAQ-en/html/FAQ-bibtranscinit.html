<h3>Transcribed initials in BibTeX</h3>
<p>If your bibliographic style uses initials + surname, you may encounter
a problem with some transcribed names (for example, Russian ones).
Consider the following example from the real world:
<blockquote>

<pre>
@article{epifanov1997,
   author = {Epifanov, S. Yu. and Vigasin, A. A.},
   title  = ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
Note that the &ldquo;Yu&rdquo; is the initial, not a complete name. However,
BibTeX&rsquo;s algorithms will leave you with a citation &mdash; 
slightly depending on the bibliographic style &mdash; that reads:
&ldquo;S. Y. Epifanov and A. A. Vigasin, ...&rdquo;. instead of the intended
&ldquo;S. Yu. Epifanov and A. A. Vigasin, ...&rdquo;.
<p>One solution is to replace each affected initial by a command that 
prints the correct combination.  To keep your bibliography portable,
you need to add that command to your bibliography with the
<code>@preamble</code> directive:
<blockquote>

<pre>
@preamble{ {\providecommand{\BIBYu}{Yu} } }

@article{epifanov1997,
   author   = {Epifanov, S. {\BIBYu}. and Vigasin, A. A.},
   title    = ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
If you have many such commands, you may want to put them in a separate
file and <code>\</code><code>input</code> that LaTeX file in a <code>@preamble</code>
directive.
<p>An alternative is to make the transcription look like an accent, from
BibTeX&rsquo;s point of view.  For this we need a control sequence that
does nothing:
<blockquote>
<pre>
@article{epifanov1997,
   author   = {Epifanov, S. {\relax Yu}. and Vigasin, A. A.},
   title    = ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
Like the solution by generating extra commands, this involves tedious
extra typing; which of the two techniques is preferable for a given
bibliography will be determined by the names in it.
