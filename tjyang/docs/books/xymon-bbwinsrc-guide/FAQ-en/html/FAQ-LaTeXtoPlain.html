<h3>Translating LaTeX to Plain TeX</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, no &ldquo;general&rdquo;, simple, automatic process is likely to
succeed at this task.  See 
&ldquo;<a href="FAQ-LaTeXandPlain.html">How does LaTeX relate to Plain TeX</a>&rdquo;
for further details.
<p>Translating a document designed to work with LaTeX into one
designed to work with Plain TeX is likely to amount to carefully
including (or otherwise re-implementing) all those parts of LaTeX,
beyond the provisions of Plain TeX, which the document uses.
