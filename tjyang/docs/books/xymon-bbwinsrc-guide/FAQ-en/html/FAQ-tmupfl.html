<h3>&ldquo;Too many unprocessed floats&rdquo;</h3>
<p>If LaTeX responds to a <code>\</code><code>begin{figure}</code> or
<code>\</code><code>begin{table}</code> command with the error message
<pre>
! LaTeX Error: Too many unprocessed floats.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
</pre>

your figures (or tables) are failing to be placed properly.  LaTeX
has a limited amount of storage for &lsquo;floats&rsquo; (figures, tables, or
floats you&rsquo;ve defined yourself with the <i>float</i> package); if
you don&rsquo;t let it ever actually typeset any floats, it will run out of
space.
<p>This failure usually occurs in extreme cases of


<a href="FAQ-floats.html">floats moving &ldquo;wrongly&rdquo;</a>;
LaTeX has found it can&rsquo;t place a float, and floats of the same type
have piled up behind it.  LaTeX&rsquo;s idea is to ensure that caption
numbers are sequential in the document: the caption number is
allocated when the figure (or whatever) is created, and can&rsquo;t be
changed, so that placement out of order would mean figure numbers
appearing out of order in the document (and in the list of figures, or
whatever).  So a simple failure to place a figure means that no
subsequent figure can be placed; and hence (eventually) the error.
<p>Techniques for solving the problem are discussed in the

<a href="FAQ-floats.html">floats question</a>
already referenced.
<p>The error also occurs in a 
long sequence of <code>figure</code> or <code>table</code>
environments, with no intervening
text.  Unless the environments will fit &ldquo;here&rdquo; (and you&rsquo;ve allowed
them to go &ldquo;here&rdquo;), there will never be a page break, and so there
will never be an opportunity for LaTeX to reconsider placement.
(Of course, the floats can&rsquo;t all fit &ldquo;here&rdquo; if the sequence is
sufficiently prolonged: once the page fills, LaTeX won&rsquo;t place any
more floats, leading to the error.
<p>Techniques for resolution may involve redefining the floats using the
<i>float</i> package&rsquo;s <code>[H]</code> float qualifier, but you are unlikely
to get away without using <code>\</code><code>clearpage</code> from time to time.
