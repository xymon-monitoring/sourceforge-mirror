<h3>There&rsquo;s a space added after my environment</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written your own environment <code>env</code>, and it works
except that a space appears at the start of the first line of typeset
text after <code>\</code><code>end{env}</code>.  This doesn&rsquo;t happen with similar
LaTeX-supplied environments.
<p>You could impose the restriction that your users always put a
&ldquo;<code>%</code>&rdquo; sign after the environment ... but
LaTeX environments don&rsquo;t require that, either.
<p>The LaTeX environments&rsquo; &ldquo;secret&rdquo; is an internal flag which causes
the unwanted spaces to be ignored.  Fortunately, you don&rsquo;t have to use
the internal form: since 1996, LaTeX has had a user command
<code>\</code><code>ignorespacesafterend</code>, which sets the internal flag.
