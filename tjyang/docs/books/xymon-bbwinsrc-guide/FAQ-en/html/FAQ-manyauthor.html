<h3>BibTeX doesn&rsquo;t understand lists of names</h3>
<p>BibTeX has a strict syntax for lists of authors&rsquo; (or editors&rsquo;)
names in the BibTeX data file; if you write the list of names in a
&ldquo;natural&rdquo;-seeming way, the chances are you will confuse BibTeX,
and the output produced will be quite different from what you had
hoped.
<p>Names should be expressed in one of the forms
<blockquote>
<pre>
First Last
Last, First
Last, Suffix, First
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
and lists of names should be separated with &ldquo;<code>and</code>&rdquo;.
For example:
<blockquote>
<pre>
AUTHOR = {Fred Q. Bloggs, John P. Doe &amp;
          Another Idiot}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
falls foul of two of the above rules: a syntactically significant
comma appears in an incorrect place, and &lsquo;<code>\</code><code>&amp;</code>&rsquo; is being used as a
name separator.  The output of the above might be something like:
<blockquote>
<pre>
John P. Doe &amp; Another Idiot Fred Q. Bloggs
</pre>

</blockquote><p>
because &ldquo;John P. Doe &amp; Another Idiot has become the &lsquo;first name&rsquo;,
while &ldquo;Fred Q. Bloggs&rdquo; has become the &lsquo;last name&rsquo; of a single
person.  The example should have been written:
<blockquote>

<pre>
AUTHOR = {Fred Q. Bloggs and John P. Doe and
          Another Idiot}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
Some bibliography styles implement clever acrobatics with very long
author lists.  You can force truncation by using the pseudo-name
&ldquo;<code>others</code>&rdquo;, which will usually translate to something like
&ldquo;<em>et al</em>&rdquo; in the typeset output.  So, if Mr. Bloggs wanted to
distract attention from his co-authors, he would write:
<blockquote>
<pre>
AUTHOR = {Fred Q. Bloggs and others}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
