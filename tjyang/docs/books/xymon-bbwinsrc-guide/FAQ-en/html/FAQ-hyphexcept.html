<h3>Hyphenation exceptions</h3>
<p>While TeX&rsquo;s hyphenation rules are good, they&rsquo;re not infallible: you
will occasionally find words TeX just gets <em>wrong</em>.  So for
example, TeX&rsquo;s default hyphenation rules (for American English) don&rsquo;t
know the word &ldquo;<em>manuscript</em>&rdquo;, and since it&rsquo;s a long word you
may find you need to hyphenate it.  You <em>can</em> &ldquo;write the
hyphenation out&rdquo; each time you use the word:
<blockquote>
<pre>
... man\-u\-script ...
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
Here, each of the <code>\</code><code>-</code> commands is converted to a hyphenated break,
if (<em>and only if</em>) necessary.
<p>That technique can rapidly become tedious: you&rsquo;ll probably only accept
it if there are no more than one or two wrongly-hyphenated words in
your document.  The alternative is to set up hyphenations in the
document preamble.  To do that, for the hyphenation above, you would
write:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\hyphenation{man-u-script}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
and the hyphenation would be set for the whole document.  Barbara
Beeton publishes articles containing lists of these &ldquo;hyphenation
exceptions&rdquo;, in <i>TUGboat</i>; the hyphenation &lsquo;man-u-script&rsquo;
comes from one of those articles.
<p>What if you have more than one language in your document?  Simple:
select the appropriate language, and do the same as above:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\usepackage[french]{babel}
\selectlanguage{french}
\hyphenation{re-cher-cher}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
(nothing clever here: this is the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; hyphenation of the word,
in the current tables).  However, there&rsquo;s a problem here: just as
words with accents in them won&rsquo;t break, so <code>\</code><code>hyphenation</code> commands
with accents in them produce an error:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\usepackage[french]{babel}
\selectlanguage{french}
\hyphenation{r\'e-f\'e-rence}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
tells us that the hyphenation is &ldquo;improper&rdquo;, and that it will be &ldquo;flushed&rdquo;.
But, just as hyphenation of words is enabled by selecting an 8-bit
font encoding, so <code>\</code><code>hyphenation</code> commands are rendered proper again
by selecting that same 8-bit font encoding.  For the hyphenation
patterns provided in the usual distributions, the encoding is
<a href="FAQ-ECfonts.html">Cork</a>, so the complete sequence is:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[french]{babel}
\selectlanguage{french}
\hyphenation{r\'e-f\'e-rence}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
<p>The same sort of performance goes for any language for which 8-bit
fonts and corresponding hyphenation patterns are available.  Since you
have to select both the language and the font encoding to have your
document typeset correctly, it should not be a great imposition to do
the selections before setting up hyphenation exceptions.
