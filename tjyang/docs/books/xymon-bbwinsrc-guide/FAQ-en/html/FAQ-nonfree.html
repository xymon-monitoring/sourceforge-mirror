<h3>What&rsquo;s the CTAN <code>nonfree</code> tree?</h3>
<p>The CTAN archives are currently restructuring their holdings
so that files that are &lsquo;not free&rsquo; are held in a separate tree.  The
definition of what is &lsquo;free&rsquo; (for this purpose) is influenced by, but
not exactly the same as the 


<a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)</a>.
<p>Material is placed on the <code>nonfree</code> tree if it is not
freely-usable (e.g., if the material is shareware, commercial, or if
its usage is not permitted in certain domains at all, or without
payment).  Users of the archive should check that they are entitled to
use material they have retrieved from the <code>nonfree</code> tree.
<p>The Catalogue (one of the prime sources for finding TeX-related
material via 
<a href="FAQ-findfiles.html">web search</a>) lists the licence details in each
entry in its lists.
For details of the licence categories, see its 
<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/licenses.html">list of licences</a>.
