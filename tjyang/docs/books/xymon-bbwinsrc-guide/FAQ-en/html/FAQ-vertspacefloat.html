<h3>Extra vertical space in floats</h3>
<p>A common complaint is that extra vertical space has crept into
<code>figure</code> or <code>table</code> floating environments.
More common still are users who post code that introduces this extra
space, and <em>haven&rsquo;t noticed the problem</em>!
<p>The trouble arises from the fact that the <code>center</code>
environment (and its siblings <code>flushleft</code> and
<code>flushright</code>) are actually based on LaTeX&rsquo;s
list-handling code; and lists always separate themselves from the
material around them.  Meanwhile, there are parameters provided to
adjust the spacing between floating environments and their
surroundings; so if we have:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
   \includegraphics{...}
   \caption{...}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
or worse still:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
   \includegraphics{...}
 \end{center}
 \caption{...}
\end{figure}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
unwarranted vertical space is going to appear.
<p>The solution is to let the float and the objects in it position
themselves, and to use &ldquo;generic&rdquo; layout commands rather than their
list-based encapsulations.
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{...}
  \caption{...}
\end{figure}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
(which even involves less typing).
<p>This alternative code will work with any LaTeX package.  It will
not work with obsolete (pre-LaTeX2e) packages such as
<i>psfig</i> or <i>epsf</i> &mdash; see 
<a href="FAQ-impgraph.html">graphics inclusion</a> for discussion of the
genesis of <code>\</code><code>includegraphics</code>.
