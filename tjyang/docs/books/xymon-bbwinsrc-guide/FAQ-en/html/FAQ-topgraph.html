<h3>Top-aligning imported graphics</h3>
<p>When TeX sets a line of anything, it ensures that the base-line of
each object in the line is at the same level as the base-line of the
final object.  (Apart, of course, from <code>\</code><code>raisebox</code> commands...)
<p>Most imported graphics have their base-line set at the bottom of the
picture.  When using packages such as <i>subfig</i>, one often
wants to align figures by their tops.  The following odd little bit of
code does this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\vtop{%
  \vskip0pt
  \hbox{%
    \includegraphics{figure}%
  }%
}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
The <code>\</code><code>vtop</code> primitive sets the base-line of the resulting object to
that of the first &ldquo;line&rdquo; in it; the <code>\</code><code>vskip</code> creates the illusion
of an empty line, so <code>\</code><code>vtop</code> makes the very top of the box into the
base-line.
<p>In cases where the graphics are to be aligned with text, there is a
case for making the base-line one ex-height below the top of the box,
as in:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\vtop{%
  \vskip-1ex
  \hbox{%
    \includegraphics{figure}%
  }%
}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
A more LaTeX-y way of doing the job (somewhat innefficiently) uses
the <i>calc</i> package:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\usepackage{calc}
...
\raisebox{1ex-\height}{\includegraphics{figure}}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
(this has the same effect as the text-align version, above).
<p>The fact is, <em>you</em> may choose where the base-line ends up.  This
answer merely shows you sensible choices you might make.
