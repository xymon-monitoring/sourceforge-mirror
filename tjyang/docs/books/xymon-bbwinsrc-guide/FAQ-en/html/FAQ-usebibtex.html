<h3>&ldquo;Normal&rdquo; use of BibTeX from LaTeX</h3>
<p>To create a bibliography for your document, you need to perform a
sequence of steps, some of which seem a bit odd.  If you choose to use
BibTeX, the sequence is:
<p>First: you need a BibTeX bibliography file (a <code>.bib</code> file) &mdash; see

&ldquo;<a href="FAQ-buildbib.html">creating a BibTeX file</a>&rdquo;.
<p>Second: you must write your LaTeX document to include a declaration
of the &lsquo;style&rsquo; of bibliography, citations, and a reference to the
bibliography file mentioned in the step 1.  So we may have a LaTeX
file containing:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\bibliographystyle{plain}
...
Pooh is heroic~\cite{Milne:1926}.
...
Alice struggles~\cite{Carroll:1865}.
...
\bibliography{mybooks}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
Note: we have bibliography style <i>plain</i>, above, which is
nearly the simplest of the lot: a sample text, showing the sorts of
style choices available, can be found on Ken Turner&rsquo;s web site:
<a href="http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~kjt/software/latex/showbst.html">http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~kjt/software/latex/showbst.html</a>
<p>Third: you must process the file.
<blockquote>
<pre>
latex myfile
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
As LaTeX processes the file, the <code>\</code><code>bibliographystyle</code> command
writes a note of the style to the <code>.aux</code> file; each <code>\</code><code>cite</code> command
writes a note of the citation to the <code>.aux</code> file, and the
<code>\</code><code>bibliography</code> command writes a note of which <code>.bib</code> file is to be
used, to the <code>.aux</code> file.
<p>Note that, at this stage, LaTeX isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;resolving&rdquo; any of the
citations: at every <code>\</code><code>cite</code> command, LaTeX will warn you of the
undefined citation, and when the document finishes, there will be a
further warning of undefined references.
<p>

<p>Fourth: you must run BibTeX:
<blockquote>
<pre>
bibtex myfile
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
Don&rsquo;t try to tell BibTeX anything but the file name: say
<code>bibtex myfile.aux</code> (because you know it&rsquo;s going to read the
<code>.aux</code> file) and BibTeX will blindly attempt to process
<code>myfile.aux.aux</code>.
<p>BibTeX will scan the <code>.aux</code> file; it will find which bibliography
style it needs to use, and will &ldquo;compile&rdquo; that style; it will note
the citations; it will find which bibliography files it needs, and
will run through them matching citations to entries in the
bibliography; and finally it will sort the entries that have been
cited (if the bibliography style specifies that they should be
sorted), and outputs the resulting details to a <code>.bbl</code> file.
<p>Fifth: you run LaTeX again.  It warns, again, that each citation is
(still) undefined, but when it gets to the <code>\</code><code>bibliography</code> command,
it finds a <code>.bbl</code> file, and reads it.  As it encounters each
<code>\</code><code>bibitem</code> command in the file, it notes a definition of the
citation.
<p>Sixth: you run LaTeX yet again.  This time, it finds values for all
the citations, in its <code>.aux</code> file.  Other things being equal, you&rsquo;re
done... until you change the file.
<p>If, while editing, you change any of the citations, or add new ones,
you need to go through the process above from steps 3 (first run of
LaTeX) to 6, again, before the document is once again stable.
These four mandatory runs of LaTeX make processing a document with
a bibliography even more tiresome than the normal two runs required to
resolve labels.
<p>To summarise: processing to resolve citations requires: LaTeX;
BibTeX; LaTeX; LaTeX.
