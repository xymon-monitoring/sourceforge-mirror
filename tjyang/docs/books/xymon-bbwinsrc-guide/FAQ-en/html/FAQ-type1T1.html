<h3>Finding &lsquo;8-bit&rsquo; Type 1 fonts</h3>
<!-- eight -->
<p>Elsewhere, answers to these FAQs recommend that you use an
&lsquo;8-bit&rsquo; font to permit 
<a href="FAQ-hyphenaccents.html">accentuation of inflected languages</a>,
and also recommend the use of Type 1 fonts to ensure that
you get <a href="FAQ-fuzzy-type3.html">good quality PDF</a>.  These
recommendations used to be contradictory: one could not just
&ldquo;switch&rdquo; from the free CM fonts to free Cork- (or similarly)
encoded Type 1 fonts.  The first approach that started to alleviate
these problems, was the development of virtual fonts that make
a good approach to the Cork encoding (see below).  Now, however, we
have &ldquo;true&rdquo; Type 1 fonts available: as always, we have an
embarrassment of riches with three free alternatives, and one
commercial and one shareware version.
<p><i>CM-super</i> is an
auto-traced set which encompasses all of the T1 and TS1
encodings as well as the T2* series (the family of encodings
that cover languages based on Cyrillic alphabets).  These fonts are
pretty easy to install (the installation instructions are clear), but
they are huge: don&rsquo;t try to install them if you&rsquo;re short of disc
space.
<p><i>CM-LGC</i> is a similar &ldquo;super-font&rdquo; set, but of much more
modest size; it covers T1, TS1 and T2{A}
encodings (as does <i>CM-super</i>, and also covers the LGR
encoding (for typesetting Greek, based on Claudio Beccari&rsquo;s Metafont
sources).  <i>CM-LGC</i> manages to be small by going to the
opposite extreme from <i>CM-super</i>, which includes fonts at all
the sizes supported by the original EC (a huge range);
<i>CM-LGC</i> has one font per font shape, getting other sizes by
scaling.  There is an inevitable loss of quality inherent in this
approach, but for the disc-space-challenged machine, <i>CM-LGC</i>
is an obvious choice.
<p><i>Tt2001</i> is a simple scan of the EC and TC
fonts, and has some virtues &mdash; it&rsquo;s noticeably smaller than
<i>CM-super</i> while being less stark than <i>CM-LGC</i>.
<p><i>Latin</i> <i>Modern</i> is produced using the
program <a href="FAQ-textrace.html"><i>MetaType1</i></a>.  The
<i>Latin</i> <i>Modern</i> set comes with T1, TS1
LY1 encoded variants (as well as a variant using the Polish
QX encoding); for the glyph set it covers, its outlines seem
rather cleaner than those of <i>CM-super</i>.  <i>Latin</i>
<i>Modern</i> is more modest in its disc space demands than is
<i>CM-super</i>, while not being nearly as stark in its range of
design sizes as is <i>CM-LGC</i> &mdash;  <i>Latin</i>
<i>Modern</i>&rsquo;s fonts are offered in the same set of sizes as the
original <i>CM</i> fonts.  It&rsquo;s hard to argue with the choice:
Knuth&rsquo;s range of sizes has stood the test of time, and is one of the
bases on which the excellence of the TeX system rests.
<p><a href="FAQ-virtualfonts.html">Virtual fonts</a> help us deal with the problem,
since they allow us to map &ldquo;bits of DVI file&rdquo; to single
characters in the virtual font; so we can create an &ldquo;&eacute;&rdquo; character
by recreating the DVI commands that would result from the code
&ldquo;<code>\&rsquo;</code><code>e</code>&rdquo;.  However, since this involves two characters being
selected from a font, the arrangement is sufficient to fool
<i>Acrobat</i> <i>Reader</i>: you can&rsquo;t use the program&rsquo;s
facilities for searching for text that contains inflected characters,
and if you <em>cut</em> text from a window that contains such a
character, you&rsquo;ll find something unexpected (typically the accent and
the &lsquo;base&rsquo; characters separated by a space) when you <i>paste</i>
the result.  However, if you can live with this difficulty, virtual
fonts are a useful and straightforward solution to the problem.
<p>There are two virtual-font offerings of CM-based 8-bit
fonts &mdash; the <i>ae</i> (&ldquo;almost EC&rdquo;) and
<i>zefonts</i> sets; the <i>zefonts</i> set has wider coverage
(though the <i>ae</i> set may be extended to offer guillemets by
use of the <i>aeguill</i> package).  Neither offers characters such
as <code>eth</code> and <code>thorn</code> (used in, for example, in
Icelandic), but the <i>aecompl</i> package works with the
<i>ae</i> fonts to provide the missing characters from the
EC fonts (i.e., as bitmaps).
<p>The sole remaining commercial CM-like 8-bit font comes from
Micropress, who offer the complete EC set
in Type 1 format, as part of their range of outline versions of fonts
that were originally distributed in Metafont format.  See
<a href="FAQ-commercial.html">&ldquo;commercial distributions&rdquo;</a>.
<p>The shareware 
<a href="FAQ-TeXsystems.html">BaKoMa TeX distribution</a> offers a
set of Type 1 EC fonts, as an extra shareware option.  (As far
as the present author can tell, these fonts are <em>only</em> available
to users of BaKoMa TeX: they are stored in an archive format that
seems not to be publicly available.)
<p>Finally, you can use one of the myriad text fonts available in Type 1
format (with appropriate PSNFSS metrics for T1 encoding,
or metrics for some other 8-bit encoding such as LY1).  However,
if you use someone else&rsquo;s text font (even something as simple as
Adobe&rsquo;s Times family) you have to find a matching family of
mathematical fonts, which is a non-trivial undertaking &mdash;
