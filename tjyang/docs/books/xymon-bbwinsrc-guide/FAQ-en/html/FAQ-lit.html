<h3>What is Literate Programming?</h3>
<p>Literate programming is the combination of documentation and source
together in a fashion suited for reading by human beings. 
In general, literate programs combine source
and documentation in a single file.  Literate programming tools then
parse the file to produce either readable documentation or compilable
source.  The WEB style of literate programming was created by
D. E. Knuth during the development of TeX.
<p>
  The <a href="FAQ-dtx.html">&ldquo;documented LaTeX&rdquo;</a> style of programming
is regarded by some as a form of literate programming, though it only
contains a subset of the constructs Knuth used.
<p>Discussion of literate programming is conducted in the newsgroup
<i>comp.programming.literate</i>, whose FAQ is stored on
CTAN.  Another good source of information is
