<h3>How to get help</h3>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve looked at all relevant <a href="FAQ-whereFAQ.html">FAQs</a> you
can find, you&rsquo;ve looked in any <a href="FAQ-books.html">books</a> you have, and
scanned relevant <a href="FAQ-tutorialstar.html">tutorials</a>... and still you
don&rsquo;t know what to do.
<p>    If you are seeking a particular package or program, look on your own
system first: you might already have it &mdash; the better TeX
distributions contain a wide range of supporting material.  The
CTAN Catalogue can also help: you can
<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/search">search it</a>, or you can browse it
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html">by topic</a>&rdquo;.

A catalogue entry has a description of the package, and links to any
documentation known on the net.  ... when the entry is up-to-date.
<p>Failing all that, look to see if anyone else has had the problem
before; there are two places where people ask: browse or search the
newsgroup <i>comp.text.tex</i> via
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex">Google groups</a>,
and the mailing list <code>texhax</code> via its
<a href="http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/">archive</a>
<p>If those &ldquo;back question&rdquo; searches fail, you&rsquo;ll have to ask the world
at large.  To ask a question on <i>comp.text.tex</i>, you can use
your own news client (if you have one), or use the &ldquo;start a new
topic&rdquo; button on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex">http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex</a>.
To ask a question on <code>texhax</code>, you may simply send mail to
<a href="mailto:texhax@tug.org"><i>texhax@tug.org</i></a>, but it&rsquo;s probably better to subscribe to the
list (via <a href="http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax">http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax</a>) 
first &mdash; not everyone will answer to you as well as to the list.
