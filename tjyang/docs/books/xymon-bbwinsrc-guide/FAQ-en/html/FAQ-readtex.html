<h3>Reading (La)TeX files</h3>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve been sent a TeX file: what are you going to do with it?
<p>You can, of course, &ldquo;just read it&rdquo;, since it&rsquo;s a plain text file,
but the markup tags in the document may prove distracting.  Most of
the time, even TeX experts will typeset a TeX file before
attempting to read it.
<p>So, you need to typeset the document.  The good news is that TeX
systems are available, free, for most sorts of computer; the bad news
is that you need a pretty complete TeX system even to read a single
file, and complete TeX systems are pretty large.
<p>TeX is a typesetting system that arose from a publishing project (see
<a href="FAQ-whatTeX.html">what is TeX</a>),
and its basic source is available free from its author.  However, at
its root, it is <em>just</em> a typesetting engine: even to view or to
print the typeset output, you will need anciliary programs.  In short,
you need a TeX <em>distribution</em> &mdash; a collection of
TeX-related programs tailored to your operating system: for details
of the sorts of things that are available, see

&ldquo;<a href="FAQ-TeXsystems.html">TeX distributions</a>&rdquo;
or

&ldquo;<a href="FAQ-commercial.html">commercial TeX distributions</a>&rdquo;.
<p>But beware &mdash; TeX makes no attempt to look like the sort of
WYSIWYG system you&rsquo;re probably used to (see

<a href="FAQ-notWYSIWYG.html">why is TeX not WYSIWYG</a>):
while many modern versions of TeX have a compile&ndash;view cycle that
rivals the best commercial word processors in its responsiveness, what
you type is usually <em>markup</em>, which typically defines a logical
(rather than a visual) view of what you want typeset.
<p>However, in this context markup proves to be a blessing in disguise: a
good proportion of most TeX documents is immediately readable in an
ordinary text editor.  So, while you need to install a considerable
system to attain the full benefits of the TeX document that you
were sent, the chances are you can understand quite a bit of it with
nothing more than the ordinary tools you already have on your computer.
