<h3>Capacity exceeded [semantic nest ...]</h3>
<p>
<pre>
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [semantic nest size=100].
...
If you really absolutely need more capacity,
you can ask a wizard to enlarge me.
</pre>
Even though TeX suggests (as always) that enlargement by a wizard
may help, this message usually results from a broken macro or bad
parameters to an otherwise working macro.
<p>The &ldquo;semantic nest&rdquo; TeX talks about is the nesting
of boxes within boxes.  A stupid macro can provoke the error pretty
easily:
<blockquote>

<pre>
\def\silly{\hbox{here's \silly being executed}}
\silly
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
The extended traceback

(see <a href="FAQ-erroradvice.html"><em>general advice</em> on errors</a>)
<em>does</em> help, though it does rather run on.  In the case above,
the traceback consists of
<pre>
\silly -&gt;\hbox {
                here's \silly being executed}
</pre>
followed by 100 instances of
<pre>
\silly -&gt;\hbox {here's \silly 
                              being executed}
</pre>
The repeated lines are broken at exactly the offending macro; of
course the loop need not be as simple as this &mdash; if <code>\</code><code>silly</code> calls
<code>\</code><code>dopy</code> which boxes <code>\</code><code>silly</code>, the effect is just the same and
alternate lines in the traceback are broken at alternate positions.
<p>There are in fact two items being consumed when you nest boxes: the
other is the grouping level.  Whether you exhaust your 
<em>semantic nest</em> or your permitted <em>grouping levels</em> first is
controlled entirely by the relative size of the two different sets of
buffers in your (La)TeX executable.
