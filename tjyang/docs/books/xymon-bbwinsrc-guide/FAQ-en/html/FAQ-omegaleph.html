<h3>Omega and Aleph</h3>
<p>Omega  was developed as an extension of
TeX, to use with multilingual texts, expressed in a variety of
input encodings.  Omega uses 16-bit, Unicode-encoded, characters.  It
provides many innovative concepts, notably including the &ldquo;translation
process&rdquo; that takes a character stream and transforms it according to
various processes that may be internally specified, or be a separate
program.
<p>While Omega showed a lot of promise at its mid-1990s announcement, its
development was slow, and development was essentially dead by the time
that one of the original developers withdrew (taking with him a bunch
of research students).
<p>Before that distressing event, a separate thread of development was
started, to produce a program called Aleph
, which merged the facilities of
<a href="FAQ-etex.html">e-TeX</a> into a stable Omega codebase and added other
extensions.  Aleph also proved an attractive platform for many people;
but its development, too, has dried up.
<p>The latest news (from EuroTeX 2006) is that development of Omega is
picking up again, in parallel with research into what the (new)
authors consider a rational scheme for supporting TeX-style
typesetting.  The new system is to be known as Omega-2
(Omega subscript 2), and is being
designed in a modular fashion so that support of new facilities (such
as use of advanced OpenType fonts) can be added in a relatively
straightforward fashion.
<p>The work done in the Aleph project is also being carried forward in
the <a href="FAQ-luatex.html">LUATeX</a> project.
