<h3>Diagonal separation in corner cells of tables</h3>
<p>You want to label both the top or bottom row and the left- or
rightmost column, somewhere at the corner of the table where the row
and column meet.  A simple way to achieve the result is to construct
the table with an arrangement of rules (and possibly <code>\</code><code>multicolumn</code>
entries), to look like:
<blockquote>
<pre>
-----------------
x  y
   --------------
   1  2  3  4  5
-----------------
1
2
3
4
5
-----------------
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
However, this doesn&rsquo;t satisfy everyone: many want the labelling in a
single cell at the top left of the table.  It sounds a simple enough
requirement, yet it calls for some slightly tricky LaTeX coding.
The <i>slashbox</i> package does the job for you: it defines
commands <code>\</code><code>slashbox</code> and <code>\</code><code>backslashbox</code>, each taking the two
labels as arguments.  It draws a picture with the two labels on either
side of a slanting line; the command (and hence the picture) may be
placed in the corner cell, where the labelled row and column meet.
<p>The package isn&rsquo;t the world&rsquo;s neatest: it uses LaTeX
<code>picture</code> mode to draw its line, and picture mode has many
tedious restrictions (and doesn&rsquo;t, in all honesty, produce
particularly good pictures).  Load slashbox with the <i>pict2e</i>
package, and at least the picture quality will be improved.
<p>Documentation of <i>slashbox</i> is less than satisfactory: a
LaTeX source file of rather startling starkness accompanies the
package file in the distribution.  It does, however, process to a
DVI file that gives some idea of how the <code>\</code><code>slashbox</code> may be
expected to look.  (The third example in the file shows the effect of
<code>picture</code> mode&rsquo;s restrictions: the dividing line doesn&rsquo;t
go from corner to corner in the box: to correct this requires revision
of <i>slashbox</i> &mdash; <i>pict2e</i> alone doesn&rsquo;t help in this
regard.)
