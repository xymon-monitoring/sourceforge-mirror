<h3>Using the Latin Modern fonts</h3>
<p>The <i>lm</i> fonts are an exciting addition to
the armoury of the (La)TeX user: high quality outlines of fonts that
were until recently difficult to obtain, all in a free and
relatively compact package.  However, the spartan information file
that comes with the fonts remarks &ldquo;It is presumed that a potential
user knows what to do with all these files&rdquo;.  This answer aims to
fill in the requirements: the job is really not terribly difficult.
<p>Note that teTeX distributions, from version 3.0, already have the
<i>lm</i> fonts: all you need do is use them.  The fonts may also
be installed via the package manager, in a current MiKTeX system.
The remainder of this answer, then, is for people who don&rsquo;t use such
systems.
<p>The font (and related) files appear on CTAN as a set of
single-entry <a href="FAQ-tds.html">TDS trees</a> &mdash;
<i>fonts</i>, <i>dvips</i>, <i>tex</i> and <i>doc</i>.  The <i>doc</i>
subtree really need not be copied (it&rsquo;s really a pair of sample
files), but copy the other three into your existing Local <code>$TEXMF</code>
tree, and

<a href="FAQ-instpackages.html">update the filename database</a>.
<p>Now, incorporate the fonts in the set searched by PDFLaTeX,
<i>dvips</i>, <i>dvipdfm</i>, your previewers and
Type 1-to-PK conversion programs, by
<ul>
<li> On a teTeX system earlier than version 2.0, edit the file
  <i>$TEXMF/dvips/config/updmap</i> and insert an absolute path for
  the <i>lm.map</i> just after the line that starts
  <code>extra_modules="</code> (and before the closing quotes).
<li> On a teTeX version 2.0 (or later), execute the command
<pre>
  updmap --enable Map lm.map
</pre>
<li> On a MiKTeX system earlier than version 2.2, the &ldquo;Refresh
  filename database&rdquo; operation, which you performed after installing
  files, also updates the system&rsquo;s &ldquo;PostScript resources database&rdquo;.
<li> On a MiKTeX system, version 2.2 or later, update
  <i>updmap.cfg</i> as described in the MiKTeX 
  <a href="http://docs.miktex.org/manual/psfonts.html#chgupdmapcfg">online documentation</a>.
  Then execute the command <code>initexmf --mkmaps</code>, and the
  job is done.
</ul>
<p>To use the fonts in a LaTeX document, you should
<blockquote>
  <code>\</code><code>usepackage{lmodern}</code>
</blockquote><p>
this will make the fonts the default
for all three LaTeX font families (&ldquo;roman&rdquo;, &ldquo;sans-serif&rdquo; and
&ldquo;typewriter&rdquo;).  You also need 
<blockquote>
  <code>\</code><code>usepackage[T1]{fontenc}</code>
</blockquote><p>
for text, and 
<blockquote>
  <code>\</code><code>usepackage{textcomp}</code>
</blockquote><p>
if you want to use any of the TS1-encoding symbols.  There is
no support for using fonts according to the OT1 encoding.
