<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question label hyphenaccents</title>
</head><body>
<h3>Accented words aren&rsquo;t hyphenated</h3>
<p>TeX&rsquo;s algorithm for hyphenation gives up when it encounters an
<code>\</code><code>accent</code> command; there are good reasons for this, but it means
that quality typesetting in non-English languages can be difficult.
<p>For TeX macro packages, you can avoiding the effect by using an
appropriately encoded font (for example, a Cork-encoded font &mdash; see
<a href="FAQ-ECfonts.html">the EC fonts</a>) which contains accented
letters as single glyphs.  LaTeX users can achieve this end simply
by adding the command
<pre>
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
</pre>
to the preamble of their document.  Other encodings (notably
LY1, once promoted by Y&amp;Y inc) may be used
in place of T1.  Indeed, most current 8-bit TeX font
encodings will &lsquo;work&rsquo; with the relevant sets of hyphenation patterns. 
<p>One might hope that, with the many aspirant successors to TeX such
as
  <a href="FAQ-omegaleph.html">Omega</a>, <a href="FAQ-luatex.html">LUATeX</a> and
  <a href="FAQ-extex.html">ExTeX</a>,

all of which base their operations on Unicode, that the whole basis of
encodings will change.
