<h3>Maths symbols don&rsquo;t scale up</h3>
<p>By default, the &ldquo;large&rdquo; maths symbols stay at the same size
regardless of the font size of the text of the document.  There&rsquo;s good
reason for this: the <i>cmex</i> fonts aren&rsquo;t really designed to
scale, so that TeX&rsquo;s maths placement algorithms don&rsquo;t perform as
well as they might when the fonts are scaled.
<p>However, this behaviour confounds user expectations, and can lead to
slightly odd-looking documents.  If you want the fonts to scale,
despite the warning above, use the <i>exscale</i> package &mdash; just
loading it is enough.
