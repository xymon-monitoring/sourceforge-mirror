<h3>Which font files should be kept</h3>
<p>Metafont produces from its run three files, a metrics (TFM) file, a
generic font (GF) file, and a log file; all of these files have the
same base name as does the input (<em>e.g.</em>, if the input file was
<i>cmr10.mf</i>, the outputs will be <i>cmr10.tfm</i>,
<i>cmr10.nnngf</i>

and <i>cmr10.log</i>).
<p>For TeX to use the font, you need a TFM file, so you need
to keep that.  However, you are likely to generate the same font
at more than one magnification, and each time you do so you&rsquo;ll
(incidentally) generate another TFM file; these files are
all the same, so you only need to keep one of them.
<p>To preview or to produce printed output, the DVI processor will need a
font raster file; this is what the GF file provides.  However, while
there used (once upon a time) to be DVI processors that could use
GF files, modern processors use packed raster (PK) files.
Therefore, you need to generate a PK file from the GF file; the
program <i>gftopk</i> does this for you, and once you&rsquo;ve done that you
may throw the GF file away.
<p>The log file should never need to be used, unless there was some sort
of problem in the Metafont run, and need not be ordinarily kept.
