<h3>Installing a Type 1 font</h3>
<p>The process of installing a Type 1 font set is rather convoluted, but
it may be separated into a modest set of stages.
<ul>
<li> Acquire the font.  A very small set of Type 1 fonts is installed
  in most PostScript printers you will encounter.  For those few (whose use
  is covered by the basic PSNFSS package), you don&rsquo;t need the
  Type 1 font itself, to be able to print using the font.
<p>  For all the myriad other Type 1 fonts, to be able to print using
  the font you need the Type 1 file itself.  Some of these are
  available for free (they&rsquo;ve either been donated to the public
  domain, or were developed as part of a free software project), but
  the vast majority are commercial products, requiring you to spend
  real money.
<li> Acquire the fonts&rsquo; AFM files.  AFM files contain
  information from the font foundry, about the sizes of the characters
  in the font, and how they fit together.  One measure of the quality
  of a font-supplier is that they provide the AFM files by
  default: if the files are not available, you are unlikely to be able
  to use the font with (La)TeX.
<li> Rename the AFM files and the Type 1 files to match the
  <a href="FAQ-fontname.html">Berry font naming scheme</a>.
<li> Generate TeX metric files from the AFM files.  The
  commonest tool for this task is <i>fontinst</i>; the package
  documentation helps, but other guides are available (see below).
  The simplest possible script to pass to <i>fontinst</i> is:
  <blockquote>
<pre>
\latinfamily{xyz}{}
\bye
</pre>
  </blockquote><p>
  where <code>xyz</code> is the Berry name of the font family.  This
  simple script is adequate for most purposes: its output covers the
  font family in both T1 and OT1 font encodings.  Nevertheless,
  with fancier fonts, more elaborate things are possible with
  <i>fontinst</i>: see the documentation for details.
<p>  <i>Fontinst</i> also generates map files, and LaTeX font
  definition (<code>.fd</code>) files.
<li> Install the files, in your <code>texmf</code> tree.  All the
  strictures about installing non-standard things apply here: be sure
  to put the files in the local tree.  The list gives reasonable
  destinations for the various files related to a font whose Berry
  name is &lt;<i>bname</i>&gt;:

<pre>
.pfb,
.pfa  .../fonts/type1/&lt;foundry&gt;/&lt;bname&gt;
.tfm  .../fonts/tfm/&lt;foundry&gt;/&lt;bname&gt;
.vf   .../fonts/vf/&lt;foundry&gt;/&lt;bname&gt;
.fd   .../tex/latex/fontinst/&lt;foundry&gt;/&lt;bname&gt;
</pre>
  The irregular things being <code>.map</code> files: in teTeX 3.0 and
  later, these should be placed according to the revised TDS as
<pre>
.map  .../fonts/map/dvips/&lt;foundry&gt;
</pre>
and in other (earlier) systems as
<pre>
.map  .../dvips/fontinst/&lt;foundry&gt;
</pre>
<li> Regenerate the file indexes (as described in
  <a href="FAQ-instpackages.html">package installation</a>).
<li> Update the <i>dvips</i> and other maps:
  <ul>
  <li> On a teTeX system earlier than version 2.0, edit the file
    <i>$TEXMF/dvips/config/updmap</i> and insert an absolute path for
    the <i>lm.map</i> just after the line that starts
    <code>extra_modules="</code> (and before the closing quotes).
  <li> On a teTeX version 2.0 (or later), execute the command
<pre>
  updmap --enable Map &lt;xyz&gt;.map
</pre>
  <li> On a MiKTeX system earlier than version 2.2, the &ldquo;Refresh
    filename database&rdquo; operation, which you performed after installing
    files, also updates the system&rsquo;s &ldquo;PostScript resources database&rdquo;.
  <li> On a MiKTeX system, version 2.2 or later, update
    <i>updmap.cfg</i> which is described in MiKTeX 
    <a href="http://docs.miktex.org/manual/psfonts.html#chgupdmapcfg">online documentation</a>.
    Then execute the command <code>initexmf --mkmaps</code>, and the job
    is done.
  </ul>
</ul>
The whole process is very well (and thoroughly) described in Philipp
Lehman&rsquo;s guide to font installation, which may be found on CTAN.
