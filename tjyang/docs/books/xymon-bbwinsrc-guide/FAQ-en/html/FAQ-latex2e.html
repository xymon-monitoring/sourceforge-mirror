<h3>What is LaTeX2e?</h3>
<p>Lamport&rsquo;s last version of LaTeX (LaTeX 2.09, last updated in 1992)
was superseded in 1994 by a new version (LaTeX2e) provided by
<a href="FAQ-LaTeX3.html">the LaTeX team</a>.
LaTeX2e is now the only readily-available version of
LaTeX, and draws together several threads of LaTeX development
from the later days of LaTeX 2.09.
<p>LaTeX2e has several enhancements over LaTeX 2.09, but they were all
rather minor, with a view to continuity and stability rather than the
&ldquo;big push&rdquo; that some had expected from the team.  LaTeX2e
continues to this day to offer a compatibility mode in which most
files prepared for use with LaTeX 2.09 will run (albeit with somewhat
reduced performance, and subject to bitter complaints in the log
file).  Differences between LaTeX2e and LaTeX 2.09 are
outlined in a series of &lsquo;guide&rsquo; files that are available in every
LaTeX distribution (the same directory also contains &ldquo;news&rdquo; about
each new release of LaTeX2e).
