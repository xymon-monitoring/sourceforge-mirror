<h3>Repositories of TeX material</h3>
<p>To aid the archiving and retrieval of of TeX-related files, a
TUG working group developed the Comprehensive TeX Archive
Network (CTAN).  Each CTAN site has identical material,
and maintains authoritative versions of its material.  These
collections are extensive; in particular, almost everything mentioned
in this FAQ
is archived at the CTAN sites (see the lists of software at the
end of each answer).
<p>The CTAN sites are currently \FTP{dante.ctan.org} (Germany),
\FTP{cam.ctan.org} (UK) and \FTP{tug.ctan.org} (USA).
The organisation of TeX files on all
CTAN sites is identical and starts at
<i>tex-archive/</i>.  Each CTAN node may also be accessed via
the Web at URLs <a href="http://www.dante.de/tex-archive">http://www.dante.de/tex-archive</a>,
<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive">http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive</a> and
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive">http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive</a> respectively, but not all
CTAN mirrors are Web-accessible.
As a matter of course, to reduce network load,
please use the CTAN site
or mirror closest to you.  A complete and current list of CTAN sites
and known mirrors is available as file <a href="ftp://cam.ctan.org/tex-archive/CTAN.sites">CTAN.sites</a> on the
archives themselves.
<p>For details of how to find files at CTAN sites, see
&ldquo;<a href="FAQ-findfiles.html">finding (La)TeX files</a>&rdquo;.
<p>The TeX user who has no access to any sort of
network may buy a copy of the archive as part of the
<a href="FAQ-CD.html">TeX Live distribution</a>.
