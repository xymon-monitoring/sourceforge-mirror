<h3>Getting Metafont to do what you want</h3>
<p>Metafont allows you to create your own fonts, and most TeX users
will never need to use it. Metafont, unlike TeX, requires some
customisation: each output device for which you will be generating
fonts needs a mode associated with it. Modes are defined using the
<code>mode_def</code> convention described on page 94 of <em>The Metafontbook</em>
(see <a href="FAQ-books.html">TeX-related books</a>). You will need
a file, which conventionally called <i>local.mf</i>, containing all the
<code>mode_def</code>s you will be using. If <i>local.mf</i> doesn&rsquo;t already
exist, Karl Berry&rsquo;s collection of modes (<i>modes.mf</i>)
is a good starting point 
(it can be used as a &lsquo;<i>local.mf</i>&rsquo; without modification in a &lsquo;big
enough&rsquo; implementation of Metafont). Lists of
settings for various output devices are also published periodically in
<i>TUGboat</i> (see <a href="FAQ-TUGstar.html">TUG</a>). Now create
a <code>plain</code> base
file using <i>inimf</i>, <code>plain.mf</code>, and <code>local.mf</code>:
<pre>
   % inimf
   This is METAFONT...
   **plain # you type plain
   (output)
   *input local # you type this
   (output)
   *dump # you type this
   Beginning to dump on file plain...
   (output)
</pre>

This will create a base file named <i>plain.base</i> (or something
similar; for example, it will be

  <i>PLAIN.BAS</i>
on MSDOS systems) which should be moved to the directory containing
the base files on your system (note that some systems have two or more
such directories, one for each &lsquo;size&rsquo; of Metafont used).
<p>Now you need to make sure Metafont loads this new base when it starts up. If
Metafont loads the <code>plain</code> base by default on your system, then you&rsquo;re
ready to go. Under Unix (using the default <i>web2c</i>
distribution
)
this does indeed happen, but we could for instance define a command
<i>mf</i> which executes <code>virmf &plain</code> loading the <code>plain</code> base
file.
<p>The usual way to create a font with <code>plain</code> Metafont is to start 
it with the line

<pre>
\mode=&lt;mode name&gt;; mag=&lt;magnification&gt;; input &lt;font file name&gt;
</pre>
in
response to the &lsquo;**&rsquo; prompt or on the Metafont command line. (If
<code>&lt;mode name&gt;</code> is unknown or omitted, the mode defaults to &lsquo;proof&rsquo; and
Metafont will produce an output file called

<i>&lt;font file name&gt;.2602gf</i>)
The <code>&lt;magnification&gt;</code> is a floating point number or
&lsquo;magstep&rsquo; (magsteps are defined in <em>The Metafontbook</em> and
<em>The TeXbook</em>).
If <code>mag=&lt;magnification&gt;</code> is omitted, then the default
is 1 (magstep 0).  For example, to generate cmr10 at 12pt for an epson
printer you would type
<pre>
  mf \mode=epson; mag=magstep 1; input cmr10
</pre>
Note that under Unix the <code>\</code> and <code>;</code> characters must usually be quoted or
escaped, so this would typically look something like
<pre>
  mf '\mode=epson; mag=magstep 1; input cmr10'
</pre>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have <i>inimf</i> or need a special mode that isn&rsquo;t
in the base, you can put its commands in a file (<em>e.g.</em>,
<i>ln03.mf</i>) and invoke it on the fly with the <code>\smode</code> command.
For example, to create <i>cmr10.300gf</i> for an LN03 printer, using
the file
<pre>
   % This is ln03.mf as of 1990/02/27
   % mode_def courtesy of John Sauter
   proofing:=0;
   fontmaking:=1;
   tracingtitles:=0;
   pixels_per_inch:=300;
   blacker:=0.65;
   fillin:=-0.1;
   o_correction:=.5;
</pre>
(note the absence of the <code>mode_def</code> and <code>enddef</code> commands), you would
type
<pre>
   mf \smode="ln03"; input cmr10
</pre>
This technique isn&rsquo;t one you should regularly use, but it may
prove useful if you acquire a new printer and want to experiment with
parameters, or for some other reason are regularly editing the
parameters you&rsquo;re using.  Once you&rsquo;ve settled on an appropriate set of
parameters, you should use them to rebuild the base file that you use.
