<h3>BibTeX sorting and name prefixes</h3>
<p>BibTeX recognises a bewildering array of name prefixes (mostly
those deriving from European language names); it ignores the prefixes
when sorting the bibliography &mdash; you want &ldquo;Ludwig van Beethoven&rdquo;
sorted under &ldquo;Beethoven&rdquo;, not under &ldquo;van&rdquo;.  (Lamport made a witty
deliberate mistake with Beethoven&rsquo;s name, in the first edition of his
LaTeX manual.)
<p>However, a recurring issue is the desire to quote Lord Rayleigh&rsquo;s
publications (&ldquo;Lord&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t an acceptable prefix), or names from
languages that weren&rsquo;t considered when BibTeX was designed such as
&ldquo;al-Wakil&rdquo; (transcribed from the Arabic).  What&rsquo;s needed is a
separate &ldquo;sort key&rdquo;, but BibTeX only allows such a thing in
citations of items that have no author or editor.
<p>The solution is to embed the sort key in the author&rsquo;s name, but to
prevent it from being typeset.  Patashnik recommends a command
<code>\</code><code>noopsort</code> (no-output-sortkey), which is defined and used as
follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
@PREAMBLE{ {\providecommand{\noopsort}[1]{}} }
...
@ARTICLE{Rayleigh1,
AUTHOR = "{\noopsort{Rayleigh}}{Lord Rayleigh}",
...
}
</pre>

</blockquote><p>
Note that this <code>\</code><code>noopsort</code> applies to the last name in this kind of
construct, so an author with an Arabic name might be rendered:
<blockquote>
<pre>
...
AUTHOR = "Ali {\noopsort{Hadiidii}}{al-Hadiidii}",
...
</pre>
</blockquote><p>

A further use might deal with word order games, as in the famous
Vietnamese name:
<blockquote>
<pre>
...
AUTHOR = "\noopsort{Thanh Han The}{Han The Thanh}",
...
</pre>
</blockquote><p>

though that author seems well-acquainted with Western confusion about
the significance of the parts of his name (even to the extent of
missing out the accentuation, as above...).
