<h3>The XeTeX project</h3>
<p>XeTeX (by Jonathan Kew) is a successor to the shareware TeX/GX
program. It is a Unicode-based (UTF-8) TeX implementation which
is able to make use of Mac OS X AAT (Apple Advanced Typography)
<code>.dfonts</code> and OpenType fonts.  It uses Apple&rsquo;s Quartz system
(which facilitates the afore-mentioned font access) to generate
PDF output.
<p>A Linux version has been announced (2006); that version of course
can&rsquo;t use AAT fonts, and relies on OpenType fonts alone.
<p>The project has a <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/xetex">web site</a> for
the user who wants more than this simple answer, and you can also sign
up to a <a href="http://www.tug.org/mailman/listinfo/xetex">mailing list</a>.
