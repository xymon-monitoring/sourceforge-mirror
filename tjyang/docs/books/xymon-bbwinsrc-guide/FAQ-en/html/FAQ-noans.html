<h3>You don&rsquo;t understand the answer</h3>
<p>While the FAQ maintainers don&rsquo;t offer a &lsquo;help&rsquo; service, they&rsquo;re
very keen that you understand the answers they&rsquo;ve already written.
They&rsquo;re (almost) written &ldquo;in a vacuum&rdquo;, to provide something to
cover a set of questions that have arisen; it&rsquo;s always possible that
they&rsquo;re written in a way that a novice won&rsquo;t understand them.
<p>Which is where you can help the community.  Mail the 
  <a href="mailto:faq-devel@tex.ac.uk">maintainers</a>

to report the answer that you find unclear, and (if you can) suggest
what we need to clarify.  Time permitting (the team is small and all
its members are busy), we&rsquo;ll try and clarify the answer.  This way,
with a bit of luck, we can together improve the value of this resource
to the whole community.
<p>Note that the FAQ development email address is not for
answering questions: it&rsquo;s for you to suggest which questions we should
work on, or new questions we should answer in future editions.
<p>Those who simply ask questions at that address will be referred to
<a href="mailto:texhax@tug.org"><i>texhax@tug.org</i></a> or to <i>comp.text.tex</i>.
