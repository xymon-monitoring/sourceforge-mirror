<h3>The comma as a decimal separator</h3>
<p>If you use a comma in maths mode, you get a small space after it; this
space is inappropriate if the comma is being used as a decimal
separator.  An easy solution to this problem, in maths
mode, is to type <code>3</code><code>{,}</code><code>14</code> instead of typing
<code>3,14</code>.  However, if your language&rsquo;s
typographic rules require the comma as a decimal separator, such usage
can rapidly become extremely tiresome.  There are two packages that
can help relieve the tedium: <i>icomma</i> and <i>ziffer</i>.
<p><i>Icomma</i> ensures that there will be no extra space after a
comma, unless you type a space after it (as in <code>f(x, y)</code>, for
instance), in which case the usual small space after the comma
appears.  <i>Ziffer</i> is specifically targeted at the needs of
those typesetting German, but covers the present need, as well as
providing the double-minus sign used in German (and other languages)
for the empty &lsquo;cents&rsquo; part of an amount of currency.
