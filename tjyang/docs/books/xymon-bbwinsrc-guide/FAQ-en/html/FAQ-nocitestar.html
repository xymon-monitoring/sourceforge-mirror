<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question label nocite*</title>
</head><body>
<h3>Listing all your BibTeX entries</h3>
<p>LaTeX and BibTeX co-operate to offer special treatment of this
requirement.  The command <code>\</code><code>nocite{*}</code> is specially treated,
and causes BibTeX to generate bibliography entries for every entry
in each <code>.bib</code> file listed in your <code>\</code><code>bibliography</code> statement, so
that after a LaTeX&ndash;BibTeX&ndash;LaTeX sequence, you have a
document with the whole thing listed.
<p>Note that LaTeX <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> produce

&ldquo;<code>Citation ... undefined</code>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;<code>There were undefined references</code>&rdquo; warnings in respect of
<code>\</code><code>nocite{*}</code>.  This isn&rsquo;t a problem if you&rsquo;re running
LaTeX &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; (you <em>know</em> exactly how many times you have
to run things), but the lack might confuse automatic processors that
scan the log file to determine whether another run is necessary.
