<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question label findfiles</title>
</head><body>
<h3>Finding (La)TeX files</h3>
<p>Modern TeX distributions contain a huge array of support files of
various sorts, but sooner or later most people need to find something
that&rsquo;s not in their present system (if nothing else, because they&rsquo;ve
heard that something has been updated).
<p>But how to find the files?
<p>Some sources, such as these FAQ answers, provide links to
files: so if you&rsquo;ve learnt about a package here, you should be able to
retrieve it without too much fuss.
<p>Otherwise, the CTAN sites provide searching facilities, via the web.
The simplest search, locating files by name, is to be found on the
Dante CTAN
at <a href="http://www.dante.de/cgi-bin/ctan-index">http://www.dante.de/cgi-bin/ctan-index</a>; the script scans a
list of files (<i>FILES.byname</i> &mdash; see below) and returns a list
of matches, arranged very neatly as a series of links to directories
and to individual files.
<p>The <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/search">UK</a> and
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/search">USA</a> CTANs offer a
search page that provides
<ul>
<li> a file-name search similar to the Dante machine&rsquo;s (above);
<li> a keyword search of the archive catalogue (see below): this is a
  pretty powerful tool: the results include links to the catalogue
  &ldquo;short descriptions&rdquo;, so you can assure yourself that the package
  you&rsquo;ve found is the one you want; and
<li> a search form that allows you to use <i>Google</i> to search
  CTAN.
</ul>
<p>An alternative way to scan the catalogue is to use the catalogue&rsquo;s

<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html">&ldquo;by topic&rdquo; index</a>;
this lists a series of topics, and (La)TeX projects that are worth
considering if you&rsquo;re working on matters related to the topic.  
<p>In fact, <i>Google</i>, and other search engines, can be useful
tools.  Enter your search keywords, and you may pick up a package that
the author hasn&rsquo;t bothered to submit to CTAN.  If you&rsquo;re using
<i>Google</i>, you can restrict your search to CTAN by
entering
<blockquote>
  <code>site:ctan.org tex-archive &lt;<i>search term(s)</i>&gt;</code>
</blockquote><p>
in <i>Google</i>&rsquo;s &ldquo;search box&rdquo;.  You can also enforce the
restriction using <i>Google</i>&rsquo;s &ldquo;advanced search&rdquo; mechanism;
other search engines (presumably) have similar facilities.
<p>Many people avoid the need to go over the network at all, for their
searches, by downloading the file list that the archives&rsquo; web
file searches use.  This file, <i>FILES.byname</i>,
presents a unified listing of the archive (omitting directory names and
cross-links).  Its companion <i>FILES.last07days</i> is also useful, to
keep an eye on the changes on the archive.  Since these files are
updated only once a day, a nightly automatic download (perhaps using
<i>rsync</i>) makes good sense.
