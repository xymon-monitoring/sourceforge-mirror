<h3>Floats on their own on float pages</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes necessary to force a float to live on a page by itself.
(It&rsquo;s sometimes even necessary for <em>every</em> float to live on a
page by itself.)  When the float fails to &lsquo;set&rsquo;, and waits for the end
of a chapter or of the document, the natural thing to do is to declare
the float as
<pre>
  \begin{figure}[p!]
</pre>
but the overriding <code>!</code> modifier has no effect on float page floats; so
you have to make the float satisfy the parameters.
<a href="FAQ-floats.html">Moving tables and figures</a> offers some
suggestions, but doesn&rsquo;t solve the one-float-per-page question.
<p>The &lsquo;obvious&rsquo; solution, using the counter <code>totalnumber</code> (&ldquo;total
number of floats per page&rdquo;) doesn&rsquo;t work:
<code>totalnumber</code> only applies to floats on &lsquo;text&rsquo; pages (pages containing
text as well as one or more float).  So, to allow any
size float to take a whole page, set <code>\</code><code>floatpagefraction</code> really
small, and to ensure that no more than one float occupies a page, make
the separation between floats really big:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\renewcommand\floatpagefraction{.001}
\makeatletter
\setlength\@fpsep{\textheight}
\makeatother
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
