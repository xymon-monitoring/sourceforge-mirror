<h3>Mismatched mode ljfour and resolution 8000</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;re running <i>dvips</i>, and you encounter a stream of error
messages, starting with &ldquo;<code>Mismatched mode</code>&rdquo;.  The mode is the
default used in your installation &mdash; it&rsquo;s set in the <i>dvips</i>
configuration file, and <code>ljfour</code> is commonest (since it&rsquo;s the
default in most distributions), but not invariable.
<p>The problem is that <i>dvips</i> has encountered a font for which
it must generate a bitmap (since it can&rsquo;t find it in Type 1 format),
and there is no proforma available to provide instructions to give to
Metafont.
<p>So what to do?  The number 8000 comes from the &lsquo;<code>-Ppdf</code>&rsquo; option
to <i>dvips</i>, which you might have found from the answer

<a href="FAQ-fuzzy-type3.html">&ldquo;wrong type of fonts&rdquo;</a>.  The obvious
solution is to switch to the trivial substitute &lsquo;<code>-Pwww</code>&rsquo;,
which selects the necessary type 1 fonts for PDF generation,
but nothing else: however, this will leave you with undesirable bitmap
fonts in your PDF file.  The &ldquo;proper&rdquo; solution is to find a
way of expressing what you want to do, using type 1 fonts.
