<h3>Footnotes in captions</h3>
<p>Footnotes in captions are especially tricky: they present problems of
their own, on top of the problems one experiences with
<a href="FAQ-ftnsect.html">footnotes in section titles</a> and with 
<a href="FAQ-footintab.html">footnotes in tables</a>.  Fortunately, the
requirement for footnotes in captions is extremely rare: if you are
experiencing problems, it is worth reviewing what you are trying to
say by placing this footnote.  Note that the <i>threeparttable</i>
scheme (see, again, 
<a href="FAQ-footintab.html">footnotes in tables</a>) also applies
to notes in captions, and may very well be preferable to whatever you
were thinking of.
<p>If you <em>are</em> going to proceed:
<ul>
<li> use an optional argument in your <code>\</code><code>caption</code> command, that
  doesn&rsquo;t have the footnote in it; this prevents the footnote
  appearing in the &ldquo;List of ...&rdquo;, and
<li> put your whole float in a <code>minipage</code> so as to keep
  the footnotes with the float.
</ul>
so we have:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\begin{figure}
  \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
    ...
    \caption[Caption for LOF]%
      {Real caption\footnote{blah}}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
However, <em>as well as</em> all of the above, one <em>also</em> has to
deal with the tendency of the <code>\</code><code>caption</code> command to produce the
footnote&rsquo;s text twice.  For this last problem, there is no tidy
solution this author is aware of.
<p>If you&rsquo;re suffering the problem, a well-constructed <code>\</code><code>caption</code>
command in a <code>minipage</code> environment within a float (as
in the example above) can produce <em>two</em> copies of the footnote
body &ldquo;blah&rdquo;. (In fact, the effect only occurs with captions that are
long enough to require two lines to be typeset, and so wouldn&rsquo;t appear
with such a short caption.)
<p>The documentation of the <i>ccaption</i> package describes a really
rather awful work-around.
