<h3>&ldquo;Unknown graphics extension&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The LaTeX graphics package deals with several different types of
DVI (or other) output drivers; each one of them has a potential
to deal with a different selection of graphics formats.  The package
therefore has to be told what graphics file types its output driver
knows about; this is usually done in the &lt;<i>driver</i>&gt;<code>.def</code> file
corresponding to the output driver you&rsquo;re using.
<p>The error message arises, then, if you have a graphics file whose
extension doesn&rsquo;t correspond with one your driver knows about.  Most
often, this is because you&rsquo;re being optimistic: asking
<i>dvips</i> to deal with a <code>.png</code> file, or PDFTeX to deal with
a <code>.eps</code> file: the solution in this case is to transform the graphics
file to a format your driver knows about.
<p>If you happen to <em>know</em> that your device driver deals with the
format of your file, you are probably falling foul of a limitation of
the file name parsing code that the graphics package uses.  Suppose
you want to include a graphics file <i>home.bedroom.eps</i> using the
<i>dvips</i> driver; the package will conclude that your file&rsquo;s
extension is <i>.bedroom.eps</i>, and will complain.  To get around
this limitation, you have three alternatives:
<ul>
<li> Rename the file &mdash; for example <i>home.bedroom.eps</i>-&gt; 
  <i>home-bedroom.eps</i>
<li> Mask the first dot in the file name:
<pre>
\newcommand*{\DOT}{.}
\includegraphics{home\DOT bedroom.eps}
</pre>
<li> Tell the graphics package what the file is, by means of options
  to the <code>\</code><code>includegraphics</code> command:

<pre>
\includegraphics[type=eps,ext=.eps,read=.eps]{home.bedroom}
</pre>
</ul>
