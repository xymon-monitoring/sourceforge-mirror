<h3>What is Lollipop?</h3>
<p>Lollipop is a macro package written by Victor Eijkhout; it was used in
the production of his book &ldquo;<em>TeX by Topic</em>&rdquo; (see
<a href="FAQ-ol-books.html">(La)TeX Tutorials</a>).  The manual says of
it:
<blockquote>
  Lollipop is &lsquo;TeX made easy&rsquo;. Lollipop is a macro package that
  functions as a toolbox for writing TeX macros.  It was my
  intention to make macro writing so easy that implementing a fully
  new layout in TeX would become a matter of less than an hour for
  an average document, and that it would be a task that could be
  accomplished by someone with only a very basic training in TeX
  programming.
<p>  Lollipop is an attempt to make structured text formatting available
  for environments where previously only WYSIWYG packages could be
  used because adapting the layout is so much more easy with them than
  with traditional TeX macro packages.
</blockquote><p>
<p>The manual goes on to talk of ambitions to &ldquo;capture some of the
LaTeX market share&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s a very witty package, but little sign of

it taking over from LaTeX is detectable...
