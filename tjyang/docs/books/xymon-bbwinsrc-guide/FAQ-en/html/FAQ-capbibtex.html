<h3>Capitalisation in BibTeX</h3>
<p>The standard BibTeX bibliography styles impose fixed ideas about
the capitalisation of titles of things in the bibliography.  While
this is not unreasonable by BibTeX&rsquo;s lights (the rules come from
the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>) it can be troublesome, since
BibTeX fails to recognise special uses (such as acronyms, chemical
formulae, etc.).
<p>The solution is to enclose the letter or letters, whose capitalisation
BibTeX should not touch, in braces, as:
<blockquote>
<pre>
title = {The {THE} operating system},
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
Sometimes you find BibTeX changing the case of a single letter
inappropriately.  No matter: the technique can be applied to single
letters, as in:
<blockquote>
<pre>
title = {Te{X}niques and tips},
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
If your document design specification requires a different style of
capitalisation, you should acquire a bibliography style that doesn&rsquo;t
enforce BibTeX&rsquo;s default rules.  It is definitely <em>not</em> a good
idea to enclose an entire title in braces, as in
<blockquote>
<pre>
title = {{TeXniques and tips}},
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
though that does ensure that the capitalisation is not changed.  Your
BibTeX database should be a general-purpose thing, not something
tuned to the requirements of a particular document, or to the way you
are thinking today.
