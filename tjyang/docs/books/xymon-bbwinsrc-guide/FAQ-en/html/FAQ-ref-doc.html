<h3>Reference documents</h3>
<p>For TeX primitive commands a rather nice 
<a href="http://www.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/texcrib.pdf">quick reference booklet</a>,
by John W. Shipman, is available; it&rsquo;s arranged in the same way as the
TeXbook.  By contrast, you can view David Bausum&rsquo;s 
<a href="http://www.tug.org/utilities/plain/cseq.html">list of TeX primitives</a>
alphabetically or arranged by &ldquo;family&rdquo;.  Either way, the list has a
link for each control sequence, that leads you to a detailed
description, which includes page references to the TeXbook.
<p>There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a reference that takes in Plain TeX as
well as the primitive commands.
<p>Similarly, there&rsquo;s no completely reliable command-organised reference
to LaTeX, but the NASA 
<a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/latex/">Hypertext Help with LaTeX</a> is
recently much improved.  It still talks in LaTeX 2.09-isms in places,
but it&rsquo;s been updated for current LaTeX; there are a number of
mirrors of the site, and it may be worth choosing a &ldquo;local&rdquo; one if
you&rsquo;re going to use it a lot.
