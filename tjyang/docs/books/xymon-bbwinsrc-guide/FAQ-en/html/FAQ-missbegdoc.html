<h3>Missing <code>\</code><code>begin</code><code>{document}</code></h3>
<p>Give it a file of plain text, or a LaTeX file that really does have no
<code>\</code><code>begin{document}</code> command in it, and LaTeX will produce
this error, quite correctly.  LaTeX <em>needs</em>
<code>\</code><code>begin{document}</code> so as to know when to execute the commands
that finish off the document preamble.
<p>Other than that, the error can occur as a result of an error of yours,
of a corrupt <code>.aux</code> file, or of a buggy class or package.
<p>The errors you might commit are absent-mindedly typing a document
command (such as <code>\</code><code>section</code>) in the preamble of your document,
missing the comment marker from the beginning of a line, or giving too
many arguments to one of the setup commands related to the class or a
package that you have loaded.
<p>A corrupt <code>.aux</code> file might be due to any number of things;
delete the file and to run LaTeX again, twice.  If the error
recurs, it&rsquo;s probably due to a buggy class or package.
<p>If the error occurs while LaTeX is reading a class or package, then
there&rsquo;s probably a bug in the file.  The author of the class or
package stands the best chance of finding the bug, but with luck you
(or someone you ask on a mailing list or on <i>comp.text.tex</i>)
will be able to spot the problem and provide a work-around.  Always
report such bugs, even if you have found a work-around.
