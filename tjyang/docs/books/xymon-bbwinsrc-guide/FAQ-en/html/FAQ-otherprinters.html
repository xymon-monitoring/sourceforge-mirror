<h3>Output to &ldquo;other&rdquo; printers</h3>
<p>In the early years of TeX, there were masses of DVI drivers
for any (then) imaginable kind of printer, but the steam seems rather
to have gone out of the market for production of such drivers for
printer-specific formats.  There are several reasons for this, but the
primary one is that few formats offer the flexibility available
through PostScript, and <i>ghostscript</i> is <em>so</em> good, and
has <em>such</em> a wide range of printer drivers (perhaps this is where
the DVI output driver writers have all gone?).
<p>The general advice, then, is to <a href="FAQ-dvips.html">generate PostScript</a>, and
to process that with <i>ghostscript</i> set to generate the format
for the printer you actually have.  If you are using a Unix system of
some sort, it&rsquo;s generally quite easy to insert <i>ghostscript</i>
into the print spooling process.
