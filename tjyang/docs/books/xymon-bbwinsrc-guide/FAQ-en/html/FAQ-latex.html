<h3>What is LaTeX?</h3>
<p>LaTeX is a TeX macro package, originally written by Leslie Lamport, that
provides a document processing system.  LaTeX allows markup to
describe the structure of a document, so that the user
need not think about presentation. By using document classes and
add-on packages, the same document can be produced in a variety of
different layouts.
<p>Lamport says that LaTeX
&ldquo;<em>represents a balance between functionality and ease of use</em>&rdquo;.
This shows itself as a continual conflict that leads to
the need for such things as FAQs: LaTeX <em>can</em> 
meet most user requirements, but finding out <em>how</em> is often
tricky.
