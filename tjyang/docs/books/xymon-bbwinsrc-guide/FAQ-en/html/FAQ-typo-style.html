<h3>Typography tutorials</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s also (at least one) typographic style tutorial available on
the Web, the excellent 
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.nbcs.rutgers.edu/~hedrick/typography/typography.janson-syntax.107514.pdf">Guidelines for Typography in NBCS</a>&rdquo;.
In fact, its 
<a href="http://www.nbcs.rutgers.edu/~hedrick/typography/index.html">parent page</a>
is also worth a read: among other things, it provides copies of the
&ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; document in a wide variety of primary fonts, for
comparison purposes.  The author is careful to explain that he has no
ambition to supplant such excellent books as
<a href="FAQ-typebooks.html">Bringhurst&rsquo;s</a>, but the document (though it does
contain its Rutgers-local matter) is a fine introduction to the issues
of producing readable documents.
<p>Peter Wilson&rsquo;s manual for his <i>memoir</i> class has a lengthy
introductory section on typographic considerations, which is a fine
tutorial, written by someone who is aware of the issues as they apply
to (La)TeX users.
