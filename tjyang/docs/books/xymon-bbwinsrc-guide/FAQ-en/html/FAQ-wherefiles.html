<h3>Where to put new files</h3>
<p>Where precisely you put files that you have downloaded does
depend on what TeX distribution you have. However,
assuming that you have one of the modern TDS-compliant
distributions (such as teTeX or MiKTeX) there are
some general rules that you can follow:
<p>



(1) Always install new files in a local <i>texmf</i>
tree. The root directory will be named something like:
<pre>
 teTeX:          /usr/share/texmf-local/ or
                 /usr/local/share/texmf/
 fpTeX:          c:\Programs\TeXLive\texmf-local\
 MiKTeX:         c:\localtexmf\
</pre>
(In fact, a teTeX system can be asked to tell you what its local
root is; on a Unix system, the command to use is:
<blockquote>
<pre>
kpsewhich -expand-var "\$TEXMFLOCAL"
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
the output being the actual path.)
<p>Let&rsquo;s write <code>$TEXMF</code> for this root, whatever it is for your system.
<p>
(2) In your local texmf tree, imitate the directory structure in your
main tree. Here are some examples of where files of given extensions
should go:
<pre>
.sty, .cls or .fd: $TEXMF/tex/latex/&lt;package&gt;/
.dvi, .ps or .pdf: $TEXMF/doc/latex/&lt;package&gt;/
.mf:   $TEXMF/fonts/source/&lt;supplier&gt;/&lt;font&gt;/
.tfm:  $TEXMF/fonts/tfm/&lt;supplier&gt;/&lt;font&gt;/
.vf:   $TEXMF/fonts/vf/&lt;supplier&gt;/&lt;font&gt;/
.afm:  $TEXMF/fonts/afm/&lt;supplier&gt;/&lt;font&gt;/
.pfb:  $TEXMF/fonts/type1/&lt;supplier&gt;/&lt;font&gt;/
.ttf:  $TEXMF/fonts/truetype/&lt;supplier&gt;/&lt;font&gt;/
.pool, .fmt, .base or .mem: $TEXMF/web2c
</pre>
and for modern systems (distributed in 2005 or later, such as
teTeX 3.0, using TDS v1.1 layouts):
<pre>
.map:  $TEXMF/fonts/map/&lt;syntax&gt;/&lt;bundle&gt;/
.enc:  $TEXMF/fonts/enc/&lt;syntax&gt;/&lt;bundle&gt;/
</pre>
Where of course &lt;<i>package</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>font</i>&gt; and &lt;<i>supplier</i>&gt; depend
upon what&rsquo;s appropriate for the individual file.  The &lt;<i>syntax</i>&gt;
(for <code>.map</code> and <code>.enc</code> files) is a categorisation based
on the way the files are written; typically, it&rsquo;s the name of a
program such as <i>dvips</i> or <i>pdftex</i>.
<p>&ldquo;Straight&rdquo; (La)TeX input can take other forms than the <code>.sty</code>,
<code>.cls</code> or <code>.fd</code> listed above, too.  Examples are
<code>.sto</code> and <code>.clo</code> for package and class options,
<code>.cfg</code> for configuration information, and so on.
<p>Note that &lt;<i>font</i>&gt; may stand for a single font or an entire family:
for example, files for all of Knuth&rsquo;s Computer Modern fonts are to be
found in <code>.../public/cm</code>, with various prefixes as appropriate.
<p>The font &ldquo;supplier&rdquo; <em>public</em> is a sort of hold-all for
&ldquo;free fonts produced for use with (La)TeX&rdquo;: as well as Knuth&rsquo;s
fonts, <em>public</em>&rsquo;s directory holds fonts designed by others
(originally, but no longer exclusively, in Metafont).
<p>Some packages have configuration files (commonly with file suffix
<code>.cfg</code>), and occasionally other run-time files.  The package
documentation <em>should</em> mention these things, but sometimes
doesn&rsquo;t.  A common exception is the <code>.drv</code> file, used by some
packages as part of the documentation building process; this is a
hang-over from the pre-LaTeX2e predecessor of the package
documentation process.
