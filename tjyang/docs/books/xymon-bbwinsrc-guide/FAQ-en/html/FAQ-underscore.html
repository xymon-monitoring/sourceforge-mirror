<h3>How to use the underscore character</h3>
<p>The underscore character <code>_</code> is ordinarily used in
TeX to indicate a subscript in maths mode; if you type
<code>_</code> in the course of ordinary text, TeX will
complain.  If you&rsquo;re writing a document which will contain a large
number of underscore characters, the prospect of typing
<code>\</code><code>_</code> (or, worse, <code>\</code><code>textunderscore</code>) for every one of
them will daunt most ordinary people.
<p>Moderately skilled macro programmers can readily generate a quick hack
to permit typing <code>_</code> to mean &lsquo;text underscore&rsquo;.
However, the code <em>is</em> somewhat tricky, and more importantly
there are significant points where it&rsquo;s easy to get it wrong.  There
is therefore a package <i>underscore</i> which provides a general
solution to this requirement.
<p>There is a problem, though: OT1 text fonts don&rsquo;t contain an
underscore character, unless they&rsquo;re in the typewriter version of the
encoding (used by fixed-width fonts such as <code>cmtt</code>).  So either
you must ensure that your underscore characters only occur in text set
in a typewriter font, or you must use a fuller encoding, such as
T1, which has an underscore character in every font.
<p>If the requirement is only for occasional uses of underscores, it may
be acceptable to use the following construct:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\def\us{\char`\_}
...
\texttt{create\us process}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
The construction isn&rsquo;t in the least robust (in the normal English
sense of the word), but it <em>is</em> robust under expansion (i.e., the
LaTeX sense of the word); so use it with care, but don&rsquo;t worry
about section headings and the like.
