<h3>Portable imported graphics</h3>
<p>A regular need is a document to be distributed in more than
one format: commonly both PostScript and PDF.  The
following advice is based on a post by one with much experience of
dealing with the problem of dealing with EPS graphics in this
case.
<ul>
<li> Don&rsquo;t specify a driver when loading loading whichever version of
  the <i>graphics</i> package you use.  The scheme relies on the
  distribution&rsquo;s ability to decide which driver is going to be used:
  the choice is between <i>dvips</i> and PDFTeX, in this case.
  Be sure to exclude options <code>dvips</code>, <code>pdftex</code> and
  <code>dvipdfm</code> (<i>dvipdfm</i> is not used in this scheme,
  but the aspirant PDF-maker may be using it for his output,
  before switching to the scheme).
<li> Use <code>\</code><code>includegraphics[...]{filename}</code> without
  specifying the extension (i.e., neither <code>.eps</code> nor
  <code>.pdf</code>).
<li> For every <code>.eps</code> file you will be including, produce a
  <code>.pdf</code> version, as described in 
  <a href="FAQ-pdftexgraphics.html">Graphics in PDFLaTeX</a>.  Having
  done this, you will have two copies of each graphic (a <code>.eps</code>
  and a <code>.pdf</code> file) in your directory.
<li> Use PDFLaTeX (rather than
  LaTeX&ndash;<i>dvips</i>&ndash;distillation or
  LaTeX&ndash;<i>dvipdfm</i>) to produce your PDF output.
</ul>
<i>Dvipdfm</i>&rsquo;s charms are less than attractive here: the
document itself needs to be altered from its default
(<i>dvips</i>) state, before <i>dvipdfm</i> will process it.
