<h3>Virtual fonts</h3>
<p>Virtual fonts for TeX were first implemented by David Fuchs in the
early days of TeX, but for most people they date from when Knuth
redefined the format, and wrote some support software, in 1989 (he
published an article in <i>TUGboat</i> at the time, and a plain text
copy is available on CTAN).
<p>Virtual fonts provide a way of telling TeX about something more
complicated than just a one-to-one character mapping. The entities you
define in a virtual font look like characters to TeX (they appear
with their sizes in a font metric file), but the DVI processor may
expand them to something quite different.
<p>Specifically, TeX itself only looks at a TFM file that
contains details of how the virtual font will appear: but of course,
TeX only cares about the metrics of a character, so its demands are
pretty small.  The acro{DVI} processor, however, has to understand the
details of what is in the virtual font, so as to know &ldquo;what to draw,
where&rdquo;.  So, for every virtual font read by a DVI driver,
there has to be a TFM file to be read by TeX.
(PDFTeX, of course, needs both the TFM and the
translation of the virtual font, since it does the whole job in the
one program.)
<p>You can use a virtual font:
<ul>
<li> simply just to remap the glyphs of a single font,
<li> to make a composite font with glyphs drawn from several
  different onts, or
<li> to build up an effect in arbitrarily complicated ways (since a
  virtual font may contain anything which is legal in a DVI
  file).
</ul>
<p>In practice, the most common use of virtual fonts is to remap
Adobe Type 1 fonts (see <a href="FAQ-metrics.html">font metrics</a>),
though there has also been useful useful work building &lsquo;fake&rsquo; maths
fonts (by bundling glyphs from several fonts into a single virtual
font).  Virtual Computer Modern fonts, making a 
<a href="FAQ-ECfonts.html">Cork encoded</a> font from Knuth&rsquo;s originals by using
remapping and fragments of DVI for single-glyph &lsquo;accented
characters&rsquo;, were the first &ldquo;Type 1 format&rdquo; versions available.
<p>Virtual fonts are normally created in a single ASCII
VPL (Virtual Property List) file, which includes both sets of
information. The <i>vptovf</i> program is then used to the create
the binary TFM and VF files.
<p>A &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; document, explaining how to generate a VPL,
describes the endless hours of fun that may be had, doing the job by
hand.  Despite the pleasures to be had of the manual method, the
commonest way (nowadays) of generating VPL files is to use the
<i>fontinst</i> package, which is described in detail
together with the discussion of
<a href="FAQ-metrics.html">PostScript font metrics</a>.
<i>Qdtexvpl</i> is another utility for creating ad-hoc virtual
fonts (it uses TeX to parse a description of the virtual font, and
<i>qdtexvpl</i> itself processes the resulting DVI file).
