<h3>How to type an &lsquo;@&rsquo; sign?</h3>
<p>Long ago, some packages used to make the &lsquo;@&rsquo; sign active, so that
special measures were needed to type it.  While those packages are
still in principle available, few people use them, and those that do
use them have ready access to rather good documentation.
<p>Ordinary people (such as the author of this FAQ) need only type
&lsquo;@&rsquo;.
