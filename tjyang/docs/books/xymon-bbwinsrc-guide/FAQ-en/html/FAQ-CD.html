<h3>The TeX Live distribution</h3>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have access to the Internet, there are obvious
attractions to TeX collections on a disc.  Even those with net
access will find large quantities of TeX-related files to hand a
great convenience.
<p>The TeX Live distribution provides this, together with
a ready-to-run TeX system.  The TeX Live installation disc offers
teTeX for use on Unix-like systems, and ProTeXt for use on Windows
systems.  There is also a &lsquo;demonstration&rsquo; disc and an archive snapshot
(all on CD- or DVD-ROMs).  TeX-Live 
was originally developed under the auspices of a consortium of User
Groups (notably TUG, UK TUG and
GUTenberg).  All members of several User Groups receive copies
free of charge.  Some user groups will also sell additional copies:
contact your local user group or <a href="FAQ-TUGstar.html">TUG</a>.
<p>Details of TeX Live are available from its own
  <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive.html">web page</a>
  on the TUG site.
