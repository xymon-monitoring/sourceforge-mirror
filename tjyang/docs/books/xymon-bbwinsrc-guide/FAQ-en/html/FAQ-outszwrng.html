<h3>(La)TeX PDF output prints at wrong size</h3>
<p>Having got everything <em>else</em> right, you should be aware that the
problem may have nothing to do with (La)TeX and everything to do
with the program you use for printing.  A regular cause for such
problems lies with Acrobat Reader, which by default enables its option
to scale pages to fit on the printable area of the paper.  Since a
printer can rarely print right to the edge, this means that pdf-files
will be shrunk by some (small) factor (even if the pdf-file is
formatted for A4, and your paper size is set to A4 as well).
<p>Correcting this silliness is not very hard, but the exact details
depend on the version of Acrobat Reader (or "Adobe Reader" from
version 6.0 onwards) you have installed:
<ul>
<li>  Mac OS X, Adobe Reader 6:<br>
  in the print dialogue, on the &ldquo;copies &amp; pages&rdquo; pane, you&rsquo;ll find a
  popup menu titled &ldquo;Page Scaling&rdquo;. Make sure that the menu reads
  &ldquo;None&rdquo;.
<li> Windows, Adobe Reader 6:<br>
  in the print dialogue, select &ldquo;None&rdquo; from the drop-down list
  &ldquo;Page Scaling&rdquo;.
<li> Windows, Linux Acrobat (Reader) 5.0:<br>
  In the print dialog, make sure the &ldquo;Shrink oversized pages to fit&rdquo;
  checkbox is unchecked.  It may also be useful to uncheck the
  &ldquo;Expand small pages to fit paper size&rdquo; checkbox as well.
</ul>
