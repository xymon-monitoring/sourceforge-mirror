<h3>Choice of scalable outline fonts</h3>
<p>If you are interested in text alone, you can in principle use any of
the huge numbers of text fonts in Adobe Type 1, TrueType or OpenType
formats.  The constraint is, of course, that your previewer and
printer driver should support such fonts (TeX itself <em>only</em>
cares about metrics, not the actual character programs).
<p>If you also need mathematics, then you are severely limited by the
demands that TeX makes of maths fonts (for details, see the paper by B.K.P. 
Horn in <i>TUGboat</i> 14(3)).
For maths, then, there are relatively few choices (though the list is
at last growing).  There are several font families available that are
based on Knuth&rsquo;s original designs, and some that complement other
commercial text font designs; one set (MicroPress&rsquo;s &lsquo;informal math&rsquo;)
stands alone.  &ldquo;Free&rdquo; font families that will support TeX
mathematics include:
<dl>
<dt>Computer Modern<dd>(75 fonts &mdash; optical scaling) Donald E. Knuth<br>
  The CM fonts were originally designed in Metafont, but are also
  now available in scalable outline form.  There are commercial as
  well as public domain versions, and there are both Adobe Type 1 and
  TrueType versions.  A set of outline versions of the fonts was
  developed as a commercial venture by Y&amp;Y and Blue Sky Research;
  they have since assigned the copyright to the AMS, and the
  fonts are now freely available from CTAN.  Their quality is
  such that they have become the <em>de facto</em> standard for Type 1
  versions of the fonts.
<dt>AMS fonts<dd>(52 fonts, optical scaling) The AMS<br>
  This set of fonts offers adjuncts to the CM set, including
  two sets of symbol fonts (<code>msam</code> and <code>msbm</code>) and Euler text fonts.
  These are not a self-standing family, but merit discussion here (not
  least because several other families mimic the symbol fonts).
  Freely-available Type 1 versions of the fonts are available on
  CTAN.  The <i>eulervm</i> package permits use
  of the Euler maths alphabet in conjunction with text fonts that do
  not provide maths alphabets of their own (for instance, Adobe
  Palatino or Minion).
<dt>mathpazo version 1.003<dd>(5 fonts) Diego Puga<br>
  The Pazo Math fonts are a family of type 1 fonts suitable for
  typesetting maths in combination with the Palatino family of text
  fonts.  Four of the five fonts of the distribution are maths
  alphabets, in upright and italic shapes, medium and bold weights;
  the fifth font contains a small selection of &ldquo;blackboard bold&rdquo;
  characters (chosen for their mathematical significance).  Support
  under LaTeX2e is available in 
  <a href="FAQ-usepsfont.html">PSNFSS</a>; the fonts are
  licensed under the GPL, with legalese permitting the use of
  the fonts in published documents.
<dt>Fourier/Utopia<dd>(15 fonts) Michel Bovani<br>
  <i>Fourier</i> is a family built on Adobe <i>Utopia</i>
  (which has been released for usage free of charge by Adobe).  The
  fonts provide the basic Computer Modern set of mathematical symbols,
  and add many of the AMS mathematical symbols (though you are
  expected to use some from the AMS fonts themselves).  There
  are also several other mathematical and decorative symbols.  The
  fonts come with a <i>fourier</i> package for use with LaTeX;
  text support of OT1 encoding is not provided &mdash; you are
  expected to use T1.
<dt>MathDesign<dd>(3 entire families...so far) Paul Pichareau<br>
  This (very new: first release was in April 2005) set so far offers
  mathematics fonts to match Adobe Utopia, URW Garamond and Bitstream
  Charter (all of which are separately available, on CTAN, in Type 1
  format).  There has been a little comment on these fonts, but none
  from actual users posted to the public forums.  Users, particularly
  those who are willing to discuss their experiences, would obviously
  be welcome.  Browse the CTAN directory and see which you
  want: there is a wealth of documentation and examples.
<dt>Belleek<dd>(3 fonts) Richard Kinch<br>
  Belleek is the upshot of Kinch&rsquo;s thoughts on how Metafont might be used
  in the future: they were published simultaneously as Metafont source,
  as Type 1 fonts, and as TrueType fonts.  The fonts act as &ldquo;drop-in&rdquo;
  replacements for the basic MathTime set (as an example of &ldquo;what might
  be done&rdquo;).
<p>  The paper outlining Kinch&rsquo;s thoughts, proceeding from considerations
  of the &lsquo;intellectual&rsquo; superiority of Metafont to evaluations of why its
  adoption is so limited and what might be done about the problem, is
  to be found at <a href="http://truetex.com/belleek.pdf">http://truetex.com/belleek.pdf</a> (the paper is a
  good read, but exhibits the problems discussed in 
  &ldquo;<a href="FAQ-dvips-pdf.html">getting good PDF</a>&rdquo; &mdash;
  don&rsquo;t try to read it on-screen in Acrobat reader).
<dt>mathptmx<dd>Alan Jeffrey, Walter Schmidt and others.<br>
  This set contains maths italic, symbol, extension, and roman virtual
  fonts, built from Adobe Times, Symbol, Zapf Chancery, and the
  Computer Modern fonts.  The resulting mixture is not  entirely
  acceptable, but can pass in many circumstances.  The real advantage
  is that the mathptm fonts are (effectively) free, and the resulting
  PostScript files can be freely exchanged.  Support under LaTeX2e
  is available in <a href="FAQ-usepsfont.html">PSNFSS</a>.
<dt>Computer Modern Bright<dd>Free scalable outline versions of these
  fonts do exist; they are covered below together with their
  commercial parallels.

Fonts capable of setting TeX mathematics, that are available
commercially, include:
<dl>
<dt>BA Math<dd>(13 fonts) MicroPress Inc.<br>
  BA Math is a family of serif fonts, inspired by the elegant
  and graphically perfect font design of John Baskerville.  BA
  Math comprises the fonts necessary for mathematical typesetting
  (maths italic, math symbols and extensions) in normal and bold
  weights.  The family also includes all OT1 and T1
  encoded text fonts of various shapes, as well as fonts with most
  useful glyphs of the TS1 encoding.  Macros for using the
  fonts with Plain TeX, LaTeX 2.09 and current LaTeX are
  provided.

<dt>CH Math<dd>(15 fonts) MicroPress Inc.<br>
  CH Math is a family of slab serif fonts, designed as a maths
  companion for Bitstream Charter.  (The distribution includes
  four free Bitstream text fonts, in addition to the 15 hand-hinted
  MicroPress fonts.)

<dt>Computer Modern Bright<dd>(62 fonts &mdash; optical scaling) Walter
  Schmidt<br>
  CM Bright is a family of sans serif fonts, based on Knuth&rsquo;s
  CM fonts.  It comprises the fonts necessary for mathematical
  typesetting, including AMS symbols, as well as text and text
  symbol fonts of various shapes.  The collection comes with its own
  set of files for use with LaTeX.  The CM Bright fonts are
  supplied in Type 1 format by MicroPress, Inc.   The
  <i>hfbright</i> bundle offers free Type 1 fonts for text using
  the OT1 encoding &mdash; the <i>cm-super</i> set for
  use with T1 texts doesn&rsquo;t (yet) offer support for mathematics.

<dt>Concrete Math<dd>(25 fonts &mdash; optical scaling) Ulrik Vieth<br>
  The Concrete Math font set was derived from the Concrete Roman
  typefaces designed by Knuth.  The set provides a collection of math
  italics, math symbol, and math extension fonts, and fonts of
  AMS symbols that fit with the Concrete set, so that Concrete
  may be used as a complete replacement for Computer Modern.  Since
  Concrete is considerably darker than CM, the family may
  particularly attractive for use in low-resolution printing or in
  applications such as posters or transparencies.  Concrete Math
  fonts, as well as Concrete Roman fonts, are supplied in Type 1
  format by MicroPress, Inc.

<dt>Informal Math<dd>(7 outline fonts) MicroPress Inc.<br>
  Informal Math is a family of fanciful fonts loosely based on the
  Adobe&rsquo;s Tekton (TM) family, fonts which imitate handwritten
  text.  Informal Math comprises the fonts necessary for
  mathematical typesetting (maths italic, maths symbols and extensions)
  in normal weight, as well as OT1 encoded text fonts in
  upright and oblique shapes.  Macros for using the fonts with
  Plain TeX, LaTeX 2.09 and current LaTeX are provided.

<dt>Lucida Bright <em>with</em> Lucida New Math<dd>(25 fonts) Chuck Bigelow and
  Kris Holmes<br>
  Lucida is a family of related fonts including seriffed, sans serif,
  sans serif fixed width, calligraphic, blackletter, fax, Kris Holmes&rsquo;
  connected handwriting font, <em>etc</em>; they&rsquo;re not as &lsquo;spindly&rsquo; as
  Computer Modern, with a large x-height, and include a larger set of
  maths symbols, operators, relations and delimiters than CM
  (over 800 instead of 384: among others, it also includes the
  AMS <code>msam</code> and <code>msbm</code> symbol sets).  &lsquo;Lucida
  Bright Expert&rsquo; 
  (14 fonts) adds seriffed fixed width, another handwriting font,
  smallcaps, bold maths, upright &lsquo;maths italic&rsquo;, <em>etc</em>., to the
  set.  Support under LaTeX is available under the auspices of the
  PSNFSS, and pre-built metrics are also provided.
<p>  
  TUG has recently (November 2005) acquired the right to distribute
  these fonts; the web site

    &ldquo;<a href="http://tug.org/lucida/">Lucida and TUG</a>&rdquo;
  has details.
  
<dt>Adobe Lucida, LucidaSans <em>and</em> LucidaMath<dd>(12 fonts)<br>
  Lucida and LucidaMath are generally considered to be a bit heavy.
  The three maths fonts contain only the glyphs in the CM maths
  italic, symbol, and extension fonts.  Support for using LucidaMath
  with TeX is not very good; you will need to do some work
  reencoding fonts <em>etc</em>.  (In some sense this set is the
  ancestor of the LucidaBright plus LucidaNewMath font set, which are
  not currently available.)

























<dt>MathTime Pro<dd>Publish or Perish (Michael Spivak)<br>
  This latest instance of the MathTime family covers all the weights
  (medium, bold and heavy) and symbols of previous versions of
  MathTime.  In addition it has a much extended range of symbols, and
  many typographic improvements that make for high-quality documents.
  The fonts are supported under both Plain TeX and LaTeX2e, and
  are exclusively available for purchase from
  <a href="FAQ-commercial.html">Personal TeX Inc</a>.

Two other font sets should be mentioned, even though they don&rsquo;t
currently produce satisfactory output &mdash; their author is no longer
working on them, and several problems have been identified:
<dl>
<dt>pxfonts set version 1.0<dd>(26 fonts) by Young Ryu<br>
  The <i>pxfonts</i> set consists of
  <ul>
  <li> virtual text fonts using <i>Adobe</i> <i>Palatino</i> (or the URW
    replacement used by <i>ghostscript</i>) with modified plus,
    equal and slash symbols;
  <li> maths alphabets using <i>Palatino</i>;
  <li> maths fonts of all symbols in the computer modern maths fonts
    (<i>cmsy</i>, <i>cmmi</i>, <i>cmex</i> and the Greek
    letters of <i>cmr</i>) 
  <li> maths fonts of all symbols corresponding to the AMS
    fonts (<i>msam</i> and <i>msbm</i>);
  <li> additional maths fonts of various symbols.
  </ul>
  The text fonts are available in OT1, T1 and LY1
  encodings, and TS encoded symbols are also available.  The
  sans serif and monospaced fonts supplied with the <i>txfonts</i>
  set (see below) may be used with <i>pxfonts</i>; the
  <i>txfonts</i> set should be installed whenever <i>pxfonts</i>
  are.  LaTeX, <i>dvips</i> and PDFTeX support files are
  included.

  <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/fonts/pxfonts/doc/pxfontsdocA4.pdf">Documentation</a>
  is readily available.
<p>  The fonts are licensed under the GPL; use in published

<dt>txfonts set version 3.1<dd>(42 fonts) by Young Ryu<br>
  The <i>txfonts</i> set consists of
  <ul>
  <li> virtual text fonts using <i>Adobe</i> <i>Times</i> (or the URW
    replacement used by <i>ghostscript</i>) with modified plus,
    equal and slash symbols;
  <li> matching sets of sans serif and monospace (&lsquo;typewriter&rsquo;)

</dl>
Finally, one must not forget:
<dl>
<dt>Proprietary fonts<dd>Various sources.<br>
  Since having a high quality font set in scalable outline form that
  works with TeX can give a publisher a real competitive advantage,
  there are some publishers that have paid (a lot) to have such font
  sets made for them.  Unfortunately, these sets are not available on
  the open market, despite the likelihood that they&rsquo;re more complete
  than those that are.
</dl>
We observe a very limited selection of commercial maths font sets; a
maths font has to be explicitly designed for use with TeX, which is
an expensive business, and is of little appeal in other markets.
Furthermore, the TeX market for commercial fonts is minute by
comparison with the huge sales of other font sets.
<p>Text fonts in Type 1 format are available from many vendors including
Adobe, Monotype and Bitstream.  However, be careful with cheap font
&ldquo;collections&rdquo;; many of them dodge copyright restrictions by removing
(or crippling) parts of the font programs such as hinting.  Such
behaviour is both unethical and bad for the consumer.
The fonts may not render well (or at all, under ATM), may not have the
&lsquo;standard&rsquo; complement of 228 glyphs, or may not include metric files
(which you need to make TFM files).
<p>TrueType remains the &ldquo;native&rdquo; format for Windows.  Some TeX
implementations such as <a href="FAQ-commercial.html">TrueTeX</a> use TrueType
versions of Computer Modern and Times Maths fonts to render TeX
documents in Windows without the need for additional system software like
ATM.  (When used on a system running Windows XP, TrueTeX can
also use Type 1 fonts.)
<p>When choosing fonts, your own system environment may not be the only one of
interest.  If you will be sending your finished documents to others for
further use, you should consider whether a given font format will introduce
compatibility problems.  Publishers may require TrueType exclusively because
their systems are Windows-based, or Type 1 exclusively, because their systems
are based on the early popularity of that format in the publishing industry.
Many service bureaus don&rsquo;t care as long as you present them with a finished
print file (PostScript or PDF) for their output device.
