<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question label inputlev</title>
</head><body>
<h3>Capacity exceeded &mdash; input levels</h3>
<p>The error
<pre>
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [text input levels=15].
</pre>

is caused by nesting your input too deeply.  You can provoke it with
the trivial (Plain TeX) file <i>input.tex</i>, which contains
nothing but: 
<pre>
\input input
</pre>
In the real world, you are unlikely to encounter the error with a
modern TeX distribution.  TeTeX (used to produce the error
message above) allows 15 files open for TeX input at any one time,
which is improbably huge for a document generated by real human
beings.
<p>However, for those improbable (or machine-generated) situations,
some distributions offer the opportunity to adjust the parameter
<code>max_in_open</code> in a configuration file.
