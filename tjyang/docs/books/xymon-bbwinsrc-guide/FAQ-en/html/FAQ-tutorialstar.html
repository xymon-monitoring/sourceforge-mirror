<h3>(La)TeX Tutorials, etc.</h3>
<p>From a situation where every (La)TeX user <em>had</em> to buy a book
if she was not to find herself groping blindly along, we now have what
almost amounts to an embarrassment of riches of online documentation.
The following answers attempt to create lists of sources &ldquo;by topic&rdquo;.
<p>First we have introductory manuals, for
<a href="FAQ-man-tex.html">Plain TeX</a> and <a href="FAQ-man-latex.html">LaTeX</a>.
<p>Next comes a selection of
<a href="FAQ-tutbitslatex.html">&ldquo;specialised&rdquo; (La)TeX tutorials</a>,
each of which concentrates on a single LaTeX topic.
<p>A couple of reference documents (it would be good to have more) are
listed in an <a href="FAQ-ref-doc.html">answer of their own</a>.
<p>Next comes the (rather new) field of 
<a href="FAQ-doc-wiki.html">TeX-related WIKIs</a>.
<p>A rather short list gives us a 
<a href="FAQ-typo-style.html">Typography style tutorial</a>.
<p>Finally, we have a set of links to
<a href="FAQ-doc-dirs.html">Directories of (La)TeX information</a>, and details
of some &ldquo;<a href="FAQ-ol-books.html">books</a>&rdquo; that were once published
conventionally, but are now available on-line.
