<h3>Fuzzy fonts because <i>Ghostscript</i> too old</h3>
<!-- crippled blurry -->
<p>So you&rsquo;ve done everything the FAQ has told you that you need,
correct fonts properly installed and appearing in the <i>dvips</i>
output, but <em>still</em> you get fuzzy character output after
distilling with <i>ghostscript</i>.
<p>The problem could arise from too old a version of
<i>ghostscript</i>, which you may be using directly, or via a
script such as <i>ps2pdf</i> (distributed with
<i>ghostscript</i> itself), <i>dvipdf</i>, or similar.
Though <i>ghostscript</i> was capable of distillation from
version 5.50, that version could only produce bitmap Type 3 output of
any font other than the fundamental 35 fonts (<i>Times</i>,
<i>Helvetica</i>, etc.).  Later versions added &lsquo;complete&rsquo;
distillation, but it wasn&rsquo;t until version 6.50 that one could rely on
it for everyday work.
<p>So, if your PDF  output still looks fuzzy in <i>Acrobat</i>
<i>Reader</i>, upgrade <i>ghostscript</i>.  The new version
should be at least version 6.50, of course, but it&rsquo;s usually good
policy to go to the most recent version (version 8.12 at the time of
writing &mdash; 2003).
