<h3>What is e-TeX?</h3>
<p>While Knuth has declared that TeX will never 
<a href="FAQ-TeXfuture.html">change in any substantial way</a>, there remain
things that one might wish had been done differently, or indeed
implemented at all.
<p>The NTS project set out to produce an advanced replacement for
TeX, to provide a basis for developing such modifications: this
&ldquo;New Typesetting System&rdquo; would share Knuth&rsquo;s aims, but would
implement the work in a modern way taking account of the lessons
learned with TeX.  While a first demonstrator NTS did
appear, it wasn&rsquo;t practically useful, and the project seems no longer
active.
<p>In parallel with its work on NTS itself, the project developed
a set of extensions that can be used with a (&ldquo;true&rdquo;) TeX system.
Such a modified system is known as an e-TeX system, and the concept
has proved widely successful.  Indeed, current TeX distributions
are delivered with most formats built with an e-TeX system (for
those who don&rsquo;t want them, e-TeX&rsquo;s extensions can be disabled, leaving
a functionally standard TeX system).
<p>The extensions range from the simple (increasing the number of
available registers from 256 to 65536) through to extremely subtle
programming support.
<p><a href="FAQ-context.html">ConTeXt</a> has required e-TeX for its operation
for some time.
<p>Some LaTeX packages already specify the use of e-TeX.  Some such
packages may not work at all on a non-e-TeX system; others will
work, but not as well as on an e-TeX system.  The 
<a href="FAQ-LaTeX3.html">LaTeX team</a> has announced that future LaTeX
packages (specifically those from the team, as opposed to those
individually contributed) may require e-TeX for optimum performance.
