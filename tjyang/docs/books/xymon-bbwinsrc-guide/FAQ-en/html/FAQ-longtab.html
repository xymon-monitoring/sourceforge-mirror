<h3>Tables longer than a single page</h3>
<p>Tables are, by default, set entirely in boxes of their own: as a
result, they won&rsquo;t split over a page boundary.  Sadly, the world keeps
turning up tables longer than a single page that we need to typeset.
<p>For simple tables (whose shape is highly regular), the simplest
solution may well be to use the <code>tabbing</code> environment,
which is slightly tedious to set up, but which doesn&rsquo;t force the whole aligment
onto a single page.
<p>The <i>longtable</i> package builds the whole table (in chunks), in
a first pass, and then uses information it has written to the <code>.aux</code>
file during later passes to get the setting &ldquo;right&rdquo; (the package
ordinarily manages to set tables in just two passes).  Since the
package has overview of the whole table at the time it&rsquo;s doing
&ldquo;final&rdquo; setting, the table is set &ldquo;uniformly&rdquo; over its entire
length, with columns matching on consecutive pages.
<i>longtable</i> has a reputation for failing to interwork with
other packages, but it does work with <i>colortbl</i>, and its
author has provided the <i>ltxtable</i> package to provide (most
of) the facilities of <i>tabularx</i> (see

<a href="FAQ-fixwidtab.html">fixed-width tables</a>) for long tables:
beware of its rather curious usage constraints &mdash; each long table
should be in a file of its own, and included by
<code>\</code><code>LTXtable{</code><em>width</em><code>}{</code><em>file</em><code>}</code>.  Since <i>longtable</i>&rsquo;s
multiple-page tables can&rsquo;t possibly live inside floats, the package
provides for captions within the <code>longtable</code> environment
itself.
<p>A seeming alternative to <i>ltxtable</i> is <i>ltablex</i>; but
it is outdated and not fully functional.  Its worst problem is its
strictly limited memory capacity (<i>longtable</i> is not so
limited, at the cost of much complication in its code);
<i>ltablex</i> can only deal with relatively small tables, it doesn&rsquo;t seem
likely that support is available; but its user interface is much
simpler than <i>ltxtable</i>, so if its restrictions aren&rsquo;t a
problem for you, it may be worth a try.
<p>The <i>supertabular</i> package starts and stops a
<code>tabular</code> environment for each page of the table.  As a
result, each &lsquo;page worth&rsquo; of the table is compiled independently, and
the widths of corresponding columns may differ on successive pages.
However, if the correspondence doesn&rsquo;t matter, or if your columns are
fixed-width, <i>supertabular</i> has the great advantage of doing
its job in a single run.
<p>Both <i>longtable</i> and <i>supertabular</i> allow definition
of head- and footlines for the table; <i>longtable</i> allows
distinction of the first and last head and foot.
<p>The <i>xtab</i> package fixes some infelicities of
<i>supertabular</i>, and also provides a &ldquo;last head&rdquo; facility
(though this, of course, destroys <i>supertabular</i>&rsquo;s advantage
of operating in a single run).
<p>The <i>stabular</i> package provides a simple-to-use &ldquo;extension to
<code>tabular</code>&rdquo; that allows it to typeset tables that run over
the end of a page; it also has usability extensions, but doesn&rsquo;t have
the head- and footline capabilities of the major packages.
<p>Documentation of <i>ltablex</i> is to be found in the package file.
