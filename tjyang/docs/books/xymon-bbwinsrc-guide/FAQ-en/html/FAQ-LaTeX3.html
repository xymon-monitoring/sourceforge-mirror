<h3>The LaTeX3 project</h3>
<p>The LaTeX3 project team (see <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html">http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html</a>)
is a small group of volunteers whose aim is
to produce a major new document processing system based on the
principles pioneered by Leslie Lamport in the current LaTeX.  It
will remain freely available and it will be fully documented at
all levels.
<p>The LaTeX3 team&rsquo;s first product (LaTeX2e) was delivered in 1994
(it&rsquo;s now properly called &ldquo;LaTeX&rdquo;, since no other version is current).
<p>LaTeX2e was intended as a consolidation exercise, unifying several
sub-variants of LaTeX while changing nothing whose change wasn&rsquo;t
absolutely necessary.  This has permitted the team to support a single
version of LaTeX, in parallel with development of LaTeX3.
<p>Some of the older discussion papers about directions for LaTeX3 are
to be found on CTAN; other (published) articles are to be
found on the project web site
(<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/papers/">http://www.latex-project.org/papers/</a>), as is some of the
project&rsquo;s experimental code
(see <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/code.html">http://www.latex-project.org/code.html</a>, which allows you to
read the project&rsquo;s source repository).  You can
participate in discussions of the future of LaTeX through the
mailing list <code>latex-l</code>.  Subscribe to the list by sending a
message &lsquo;<code>subscribe latex-l &lt;<em>your name</em>&gt;</code>&rsquo; to
