<h3>PDFTeX becomes LUATeX</h3>
<p>As is said elsewhere in these FAQs, development of
<a href="FAQ-whatpdftex.html">PDFTeX</a> is &ldquo;in essence&rdquo; complete &mdash;
development of new facilities continues, but the limitations of the
present structure impose a strong limit on what facilities are
possible.
<p>Thus arose the idea of LUATeX.  LUA is a script
language, chosen because its interpreter has a very small
&ldquo;footprint&rdquo;, so it is rather easy to build it into other
applications.  So LUATeX was launched as a PDFTeX
executable with a LUA interpreter built into it.
<p>The LUATeX project is now proceeding (with monetary support
from various sources) and is pursuing avenues that many of the other
current projects have in their sights, notably Unicode character
representations and support for OpenType fonts.  Work is also in hand
to integrate the extensions pioneered by <a href="FAQ-omegaleph.html">Aleph</a>.
