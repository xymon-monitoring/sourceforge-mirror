<h3>How to approach errors</h3>
<p>Since TeX is a macroprocessor, its error messages are often
difficult to understand; this is a (seemingly invariant) property of
macroprocessors.  Knuth makes light of the problem in the TeXbook,
suggesting that you acquire the sleuthing skills of a latter-day
Sherlock Holmes; while this approach has a certain romantic charm to
it, it&rsquo;s not good for the &lsquo;production&rsquo; user of (La)TeX.  This
answer (derived, in part, from an article by Sebastian Rahtz in
<i>TUGboat</i> 16(4)) offers some general guidance in dealing with TeX
error reports, and other answers in this section deal with common (but
perplexing) errors that you may encounter.  There&rsquo;s a long list of
&ldquo;hints&rdquo; in Sebastian&rsquo;s article, including the following:
<ul>
<li> Look at TeX errors; those messages may seem cryptic at first,
  but they often contain a straightforward clue to the problem.  See
  <a href="FAQ-errstruct.html">the structure of errors</a> for further
  details. 
<li> Read the <code>.log</code> file; it contains hints to things you may
  not understand, often things that have not even presented as error
  messages.
<li> Be aware of the amount of context that TeX gives you.  The
  error messages gives you some bits of TeX code (or of the
  document itself), that show where the error &ldquo;actually happened&rdquo;;
  it&rsquo;s possible to control how much of this &lsquo;context&rsquo; TeX actually
  gives you.  LaTeX (nowadays) instructs TeX only to give you
  one line of context, but you may tell it otherwise by saying
<blockquote>
<pre>
\setcounter{errorcontextlines}{999}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
  in the preamble of your document.  (If you&rsquo;re not a confident macro
  programmer, don&rsquo;t be ashamed of cutting that 999 down a bit; some
  errors will go on and <em>on</em>, and spotting the differences
  between those lines can be a significant challenge.)
<li> As a last resort, tracing can be a useful tool; reading a full
  (La)TeX trace takes a strong constitution, but once you know how,
  the trace can lead you quickly to the source of a problem.  You need
  to have read the TeXbook (see

  <a href="FAQ-books.html">books about TeX</a>) in some detail, fully
  to understand the trace.
<p>  The command <code>\</code><code>tracingall</code> sets up maximum tracing; it also sets
  the output to come to the interactive terminal, which is somewhat of
  a mixed blessing (since the output tends to be so vast &mdash; all but
  the simplest traces are best examined in a text editor after the event).
<p>  The LaTeX <i>trace</i> package (first distributed with the
  2001 release of LaTeX) provides more manageable tracing.  Its
  <code>\</code><code>traceon</code> command gives you what <code>\</code><code>tracingall</code> offers, but
  suppresses tracing around some of the truly verbose parts of
  LaTeX itself.  The package also provides a <code>\</code><code>traceoff</code>
  command (there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;off&rdquo; command for <code>\</code><code>tracingall</code>), and a
  package option (<code>logonly</code>) allows you to suppress output to the
  terminal.
</ul>
The best advice to those faced with TeX errors is not to panic:
most of the common errors are plain to the eye when you go back to the
source line that TeX tells you of.  If that approach doesn&rsquo;t work,
the remaining answers in this section deal with some of the odder
error messages you may encounter.  You should not ordinarily need to
appeal to the <a href="FAQ-gethelp.html">wider public</a>
for assistance, but if you do, be sure to
report full backtraces (see <code>errorcontextlines</code> above) and so on.
