<h3>Why use <i>fontenc</i> rather than <i>t1enc</i>?</h3>
<p>In the very earliest days of LaTeX2e, the only way to use the
T1 encoding was <i>t1enc</i>; with the summer 1994
&ldquo;production&rdquo; release, the <i>fontenc</i> package appeared, and
provided comprehensive support for use of the encoding.
<p>Nevertheless, the <i>t1enc</i> package remains (as part of the
LaTeX 2.09 compatibility code), but it does very little: it merely
selects font encoding T1, and leaves to the user the business
of generating the character codes required.
<p>Generating such character codes could be a simple matter, <em>if</em>
the T1 encoding matched any widely-supported encoding standard,
since in that case, one might expect one&rsquo;s keyboard to generate the
character codes.  However, the T1 encoding is a mix of several
standard encodings, and includes code points in areas of the table
which standard encodings specifically exclude, so no T1
keyboards have been (or ever will be) manufactured.
<p>By contrast, the <i>fontenc</i> package generates the T1
code points from ordinary LaTeX commands (e.g., it generates the
<code>&eacute;</code> character codepoint from the command <code>\&rsquo;</code><code>e</code>).  So, unless you
have program-generated T1 input, use
<code>\</code><code>usepackage[T1]{fontenc}</code> rather than
<code>\</code><code>usepackage{t1enc}</code>.
