<h3>Limit the width of imported graphics</h3>
<p>Suppose you have graphics which may or may not be able to fit within
the width of the page; if they will fit, you want to set them at their
natural size, but otherwise you want to scale the whole picture so
that it fits within the page width.
<p>You do this by delving into the innards of the graphics package (which
of course needs a little LaTeX internals programming):
<blockquote>
<pre>
\makeatletter
\def\maxwidth{%
  \ifdim\Gin@nat@width&gt;\linewidth
    \linewidth
  \else
    \Gin@nat@width
  \fi
}
\makeatother
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
This defines a &ldquo;variable&rdquo; width which has the properties you want.
Replace <code>\</code><code>linewidth</code> if you have a different constraint on the width
of the graphic.
<p>Use the command as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
\includegraphics[width=\maxwidth]{figure}
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
