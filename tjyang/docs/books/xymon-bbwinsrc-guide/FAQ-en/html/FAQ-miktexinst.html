<h3>Installing MiKTeX &ldquo;known packages&rdquo;</h3>
<p>MiKTeX 2.1 (and later) maintains a database of packages it &ldquo;knows about&rdquo;,
together with (coded) installation instructions that enable it to
install the packages with minimal user intervention.
<p>If MiKTeX does know about a package you need installed, it&rsquo;s worth
using the system.
<p>First, open the MiKTeX packages window: click on
  <code>Start</code>-&gt; 
  <code>Programs</code>-&gt; 
  <code>MiKTeX</code>-&gt; 
  <code>MiKTeX Options</code>, and select the
  <code>Packages</code> tab.
<p>On the tab, there is an Explorer-style display of packages.
Right-click on the root of the tree, &ldquo;<code>MiKTeX Packages</code>&rdquo;,
and select &ldquo;<code>Search</code>&rdquo;: enter the name of the package you&rsquo;re
interested in, and press the &ldquo;<code>Search</code>&rdquo; button.  If
MiKTeX knows about your package, it will open up the tree to show
you a tick box for your package: check that box.
<p>If you prefer a command-line utility, there&rsquo;s <i>mpm</i>.  Open a
command shell, and type:
<blockquote>
<pre>
mpm --install=&lt;package&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote><p>
(which of course assumes you know the name by which MiKTeX refers to
your package).
<p>If MiKTeX <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> know about the package you&rsquo;re interested
in, you have to use the <a href="FAQ-instpackages.html">long-winded procedure</a>
outlined elsewhere in this FAQ.
<p>If necessary, repeat to select other packages, and then press
&ldquo;<code>OK</code>&rdquo;; MiKTeX tells you how many packages you have
selected &mdash; if you&rsquo;re happy, press &ldquo;<code>OK</code>&rdquo; again.
MiKTeX will go off, download the package (as a
<code>.cab</code> file), if necessary, install the files of the package, and then
refresh the filename database so that the files will be found.
