hg tag: option -f not recognized
hg tag [-l] [-m TEXT] [-d DATE] [-u USER] [-r REV] NAME

add a tag for the current or given revision

    Name a particular revision using <name>.

    Tags are used to name particular revisions of the repository and are
    very useful to compare different revision, to go back to significant
    earlier versions or to mark branch points as releases, etc.

    If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used,
    or tip if no revision is checked out.

    To facilitate version control, distribution, and merging of tags,
    they are stored as a file named ".hgtags" which is managed
    similarly to other project files and can be hand-edited if
    necessary.  The file '.hg/localtags' is used for local tags (not
    shared among repositories).

options:

 -l --local    make the tag local
 -m --message  message for tag commit log entry
 -d --date     record datecode as commit date
 -u --user     record user as commiter
 -r --rev      revision to tag
