# This file defines the way TCP services are tested by bbtest-net
# (part of the bbgen toolkit).
#
# A service definition looks like this:
#     service NAME
#        send "HELLO"
#        expect "OK"
#        options banner,ssl,telnet
#        port PORTNUMBER
#
# The NAME is the name of the test, and of the TCP service. If
# multiple tests share a common definition (e.g. ssh, ssh1, ssh2)
# then these may be given as "NAME1|NAME2|NAME3"
#
# If the send-string is defined, this data is sent to the service
# immediately after a connect.
#
# If the expect-string is defined, any data returned by the service is 
# matched against this. If it matches, the status will be green; if it
# does not match, the status will turn yellow. Only if the service does
# not respond at all will the status go red. If a expect-string is not 
# defined, the status will always be green if it is possible to connect 
# to the service.
#
# The options can include "banner" (to grab the banner from the 
# service), "telnet" (telnet options are to be negotiated), and
# "ssl" (perform an SSL/TLS handshake and pick up the SSL certificate).
#
# The "port" is the TCP port used for this service. This OVERRIDES
# any port number listed in /etc/services - but this also means that
# you need not define "unusual" port-numbers in /etc/services. 
# Of course, you can always define your test in bb-hosts to use a 
# specific portnumber.
#
# The send/expect string definitions must be in double quotes.
# The sequences "\r", "\n", "\t" and "\xNN" are recognized and
# converted into a carriage-return (ASCII 13), line-feed (ASCII 10),
# TAB (ASCII 8), and any byte respectively (NN=hex value).
