.TH HOBBITD_LARRD 8 "Version 4.0-RC1:  2 feb 2005" "Hobbit Monitor"
.SH NAME
hobbitd_larrd \- hobbitd worker module for updating Hobbit RRD files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "hobbitd_channel --channel=status hobbitd_larrd [options]"
.br
.B "hobbitd_channel --channel=data hobbitd_larrd [options]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
hobbitd_larrd is a worker module for hobbitd, and as such it is normally
run via the
.I hobbitd_channel(8)
program. It receives "status" and "data" messages from hobbitd via
stdin, and updates the RRD graphs so you no longer need to bother
with installing LARRD on your BBDISPLAY server. It also eliminates
the need to store all status- and data-messages to disk, which is
necessary with the standard LARRD setup.

LARRD can send data to Big Brother using both status- and data-
messages. So you will normally run two instances of this module, 
once for the "status" channel and once for the "data" channel.

Note: Some of the data collected by hobbitd_larrd is not compatible with
the RRD files generated by the Big Brother LARRD add-on. See the
COMPATIBILITY section below.


.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--debug"
Enable debugging output.

.IP "--rrddir=DIRECTORY"
Defines the directory where the LARRD RRD-files are stored. hobbitd_larrd
will use the location pointed to by the BBRRDS environment if this
option is not present.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP LARRDS
Defines the mapping between a status-log columnname and the corresponding
RRD database format. This is normally defined in the 
.I hobbitserver.cfg(5)
file.

.IP BBRRDS
Default directory where LARRD RRD files are stored.

.SH COLLECTED DATA
The following RRD-file datasets are recognized by hobbitd_larrd:
.IP la
Records the CPU load average. Data is collected from the "cpu"
status report.

.IP disk
Records the disk utilization. Data is collected from the "disk"
status report.

.IP memory
Records memory- and swap-utilization. Data is collected from the
"memory" status report. If no "memory" status is reported, it will
use the data from the Win32 client "cpu" status report to generate
this dataset.

.IP netstat
Records TCP and UDP statistics. Data is collected from the "netstat"
status report; however, this data is often sent via the Hobbit
"data" protocol, so there need not be a "netstat" column visible
on the Hobbit display.

.IP vmstat
Records system performance metrics from the "vmstat" command.
Data is collected from the "vmstat" status report; however, this 
data is often sent via the Hobbit "data" protocol, so there need 
not be a "vmstat" column visible on the Hobbit display.

.SH COMPATIBILITY

Some of the RRD files generated by hobbitd_larrd are incompatible with
the files generated by the Big Brother LARRD add-on:

.IP vmstat
The vmstat files with data from Linux based systems are incompatible,
due to the addition of a number of new data-items that LARRD 0.43
do not collect, but hobbitd_larrd does. This is due to changes in the
output from the Linux vmstat command, and changes in the way e.g. 
system load metrics are reported.

.IP netstat
All netstat files from LARRD 0.43 are incompatible with hobbitd_larrd.
The netstat data collected by LARRD is quite confusing: For some types
of systems LARRD collects packet-counts, for others it collects byte-
counts. hobbitd_larrd uses a different RRD file-format with separate
counters for packets and bytes and tracks whatever data the system is
reporting.
