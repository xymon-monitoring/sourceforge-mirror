.SH DESCRIPTION
.I bbcombotest
is a BB extension script that runs on the BBDISPLAY server. 
It combines the results of one or more of the normal
Big Brother test results into a combined test result, using
standard arithmetic og logical operators.

The resulting tests are sent to the Big Brother display server as any 
normal test - so all of the standard Big Brother functions (history,
statistics etc.) are available for the combined tests.

The tool was born from the need to monitor systems with built-in
redundancy and automatic failover - e.g. load-balanced web servers.
But other uses are possible.

bbcombotest must be installed on the BBDISPLAY server as an 
extension script, i.e. added to the $BBHOME/etc/bb-bbexttab file.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--debug"
Provide debugging output for use in troubleshooting problems with
bbcombotest.
.sp
.IP "--quiet"
Normally, the test status sent by bbcombotest includes information
about the underlying test results used to determine the current
value of the combined test. "--quiet" eliminates this information
from the test status page.


.SH FILES
.IP $BBHOME/etc/bbcombotest.cfg
Configuration file for bbcombotest, where the combined tests are defined
.IP $BBHOME/etc/bb-bbexttab
Big Brother extension-scripts file. bbcombotest must be added to this file
on the BBDISPLAY server so it will run as a Big Brother extension script.
.IP $BBLOGS/hostname.test
Big Brother status files, used to determine the current status of 
tests included in a combo-test.
