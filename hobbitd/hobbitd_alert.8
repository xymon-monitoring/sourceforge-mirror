.SH NAME
bbgend_alert \- bbgend worker module for sending out alerts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bbgend_channel --channel=page bbgend_alert [options]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
bbgend_alert is a worker module for bbgend, and as such it is normally
run via the
.I bbgend_channel(8)
program. It receives bbgend page- and ack-messages from the "page" 
channel via stdin, and uses these to send out alerts about failed 
and recovered hosts and services.

.B This module is not compatible with standard Big Brother

The operation of this module is controlled by the
.I bb-alerts.cfg(5)
file.


.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--alertcolors=color1[,color2]"
Define the colors that may generate alerts. A status with one of
these colors may trigger an alert message, if it matches one
or more rules in the bb-alerts.cfg file. A switch from an alert-
color to a non-alert color may trigger a "recovered" message.

The default is "--alertcolors=red,yellow,purple".

.IP "--config=FILENAME"
Sets the filename for the 
.I bb-alerts.cfg"
file. This option is required.

.IP "--dump-config"
Dumps the configuration after parsing it. May be useful to track
down problems with configuration file errors.

.IP "--checkpoint-file=FILENAME"
File where the current state of the bbgend_alert module is saved. 
When starting up, bbgend_alert will also read this file to restore
the previous state.

.IP "--checkpoint-interval=N"
Defines how often (in seconds) the checkpoint-file is saved.

.IP "--cfid"
If this option is present, alert messages will include a line with
"cfid:N" where N is the linenumber in the bb-alerts.cfg file that
caused this message to be sent. This can be useful to track down
problems with duplicate alerts.

.IP "--debug"
Enable debugging output.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP MAIL
The first part of a command line used to send out an e-mail with a 
subject, typically set to "/usr/bin/mail -s" . bbgend_alert will add
the subject and the mail recipients to form the command line used
for sending out email alerts.
