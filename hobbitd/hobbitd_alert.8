.TH HOBBITD_ALERT 8 "Version 3.4: 21 nov 2004" "bbgen toolkit"
.SH NAME
hobbitd_alert \- hobbitd worker module for sending out alerts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "hobbitd_channel --channel=page hobbitd_alert [options]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
hobbitd_alert is a worker module for hobbitd, and as such it is normally
run via the
.I hobbitd_channel(8)
program. It receives hobbitd page- and ack-messages from the "page" 
channel via stdin, and uses these to send out alerts about failed 
and recovered hosts and services.

The operation of this module is controlled by the
.I hobbit-alerts.cfg(5)
file, except when running in "legacy" mode via the "--legacy" option;
in that mode, it uses the old bbwarnrules.cfg and bbwarnsetup.cfg files
to determine who should receive alerts.


.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--alertcolors=color1[,color2]"
Define the colors that may generate alerts. A status with one of
these colors may trigger an alert message, if it matches one
or more rules in the hobbit-alerts.cfg file. A switch from an alert-
color to a non-alert color may trigger a "recovered" message.

The default is "--alertcolors=red,yellow,purple".

.IP "--config=FILENAME"
Sets the filename for the 
.I hobbit-alerts.cfg"
file. The default value is "$BBHOME/etc/hobbit-alerts.cfg".

.IP "--dump-config"
Dumps the configuration after parsing it. May be useful to track
down problems with configuration file errors.

.IP "--checkpoint-file=FILENAME"
File where the current state of the hobbitd_alert module is saved. 
When starting up, hobbitd_alert will also read this file to restore
the previous state.

.IP "--checkpoint-interval=N"
Defines how often (in seconds) the checkpoint-file is saved.

.IP "--cfid"
If this option is present, alert messages will include a line with
"cfid:N" where N is the linenumber in the hobbit-alerts.cfg file that
caused this message to be sent. This can be useful to track down
problems with duplicate alerts.

.IP "--legacy"
Enable the Big Brother compatible legacy mode.

.IP "--debug"
Enable debugging output.

.SH "LEGACY MODE"
When running in legacy mode, hobbitd_alert reads the alert rules defined by 
the bbwarnsetup.cfg and bbwarnrules.cfg files, as used by the old Big Brother
bbd daemon.

The legacy mode support the BB host- and page-group definitions; the initial 
delay and pagedelay settings; the "ignforall" setting, and the rules for 
host-, service- and time-definitions.

The use of an escalation delay is not supported in legacy mode. 

If a recipient name contains an "@"-sign, the recipient is believed to
be an e-mail address, and the alert is sent out using as e-mail by hobbitd_alert.
All other recipients cause the script "$BBHOME/ext/bbcompatalert.sh" to
be invoked, with the environment definitions setup as for normal external
paging scripts.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP MAIL
The first part of a command line used to send out an e-mail with a 
subject, typically set to "/usr/bin/mail -s" . hobbitd_alert will add
the subject and the mail recipients to form the command line used
for sending out email alerts.

.IP MAILC
The first part of a command line used to send out an e-mail without
a subject. Typically this will be "/usr/bin/mail". hobbitd_alert will
add the mail recipients to form the command line used for sending
out email alerts.
