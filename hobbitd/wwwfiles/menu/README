This JavaScript code is the "Tigra Menu", available from
http://www.softcomplex.com/products/tigra_menu/

On this website they give away the menu code "for free".
It does not say if re-distribution is permitted, so if you
want to be fully in the clear about your license to use
this, you should go and download the code yourself from 
the above URL.
