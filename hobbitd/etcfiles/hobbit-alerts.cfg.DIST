#
# The hobbit-alerts.cfg file controls who receives alerts
# when a status in the BB system goes into a critical
# state (usually: red, yellow or purple).
#
# This file is made up from RULES and RECIPIENTS.
#
# A RULE is a filter made from the PAGE where a host
# is located in BB; the HOST name, the SERVICE name,
# the COLOR of the status, the TIME of day, and the
# DURATION of the event.
#
# A RECIPIENT can be a MAIL address, or a SCRIPT.
#
# Recipients can also have rules associated with them,
# that modify the rules for a single recipient, e.g.
# you can define a rule for alerting, then add an
# extra criteria e.g. so a single recipient does not get
# alerted until after 20 minutes.
#
# A sample rule:
#
# HOST=www.foo.com SERVICE=http
#      MAIL webadmin@foo.com REPEAT=20 RECOVERED
#      MAIL cio@foo.com DURATION>60 COLOR=red
#      SCRIPT /usr/local/bin/sendsms 1234567890 FORMAT=SMS
#
# The first line sets up a rule that catches alerts
# for the host "www.foo.com" and the "http" service.
# There are three recipients for these alerts: The first
# one is the "webadmin@foo.com" - they get alerted 
# immediately when the status goes into an alert state,
# and the alert is repeated every 20 minutes until it
# recovers. When it recovers, a message is sent about
# the recovery.
#
# The second recipient is "cio@foo.com". He gets alerted
# only when the service goes "red" for more than 60 minutes.
#
# The third recipient is a script, "/usr/local/bin/sendsms".
# The real recipient is "1234567890", but it is handled
# by the script - the script receives a set of environment
# variables with the details about the alert, including the
# real recipient. The alert message is preformatted for 
# an SMS recipient.
#
# You can use Perl-compatible "regular expressions" for
# the PAGE, HOST and SERVICE definitions, by putting a "%"
# in front of the regex. E.g.
#
# HOST=%www.*
#      MAIL webadmin@foo.com EXHOST=www.testsite.foo.com
#
# This sets up a rule so that alerts from any hostname 
# beginning with "www" goes to "webadmin@foo.com", EXCEPT
# alerts from "www.testsite.foo.com"
#
# The following keywords are recognized:
#    PAGE      - rule matching an alert by the name of the
#                page in BB. This is the name following
#                the "page", "subpage" or "subparent" keyword
#                in the bb-hosts file.
#    EXPAGE    - rule excluding an alert if the pagename matches.
#    HOST      - rule matching an alert by the hostname.
#    EXHOST    - rule excluding an alert by matching the hostname.
#    SERVICE   - rule matching an alert by the service name.
#    EXSERVICE - rule excluding an alert by matching the hostname.
#    COLOR     - rule matching an alert by color. Can be "red",
#                "yellow", or "purple".
#    TIME      - rule matching an alert by the time-of-day. This
#                is specified as the DOWNTIME timespecification
#                in the bb-hosts file (see bb-hosts(5)).
#    DURATION  - Rule matcing an alert if the event has lasted
#                longer/shorter than the given duration. E.g.
#                DURATION>10 (lasted longer than 10 minutes) or
#                DURARION<30 (only sends alerts the first 30 minutes).
#    RECOVERED - Rule matches if the alert has recovered from an 
#                alert state.
#    MAIL      - Recipient who receives an e-mail alert. This takes
#                one parameter, the e-mail address.
#    SCRIPT    - Recipient that invokes a script. This takes two
#                parameters: The script filename, and the recipient
#                that gets passed to the script.
#    FORMAT    - format of the text message with the alert. Default
#                is "TEXT" (suitable for e-mail alerts). "SMS" is
#                a short message with no subject for SMS alerts.
#                "SCRIPT" is a brief message template for scripts.
#    REPEAT    - How often an alert gets repeated, in minutes.
