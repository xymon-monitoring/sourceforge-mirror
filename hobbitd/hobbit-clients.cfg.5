.TH HOBBIT-CLIENTS.CFG 5 "Version 4.1.2:  3 Oct 2005" "Hobbit Monitor"
.SH NAME
hobbit-clients.cfg \- Configuration for for hobbitd_client module

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ~hobbit/server/etc/hobbit-clients.cfg

.SH DESCRIPTION
The hobbit-clients.cfg file controls what color is assigned to
the status-messages that are generated from the Hobbit client
data - typically the cpu, disk, memory and procs-columns.

Note: This file is only used on the Hobbit server - it is not
used by the Hobbit client, so there is no need to distribute
it to your client systems.

.SH FILE FORMAT
Blank lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are treated as 
comments and ignored. 


.SH RULES
A rule consists of one of more filters using these keywords:
.sp
.BR "PAGE=targetstring"
Rule matching an alert by the name of the page in BB. This is the path of
the page as defined in the bb-hosts file. E.g. if you have this setup:
.IP
.nf
page servers All Servers
subpage web Webservers
10.0.0.1 www1.foo.com
subpage db Database servers
10.0.0.2 db1.foo.com
.fi
.LP
Then the "All servers" page is found with \fBPAGE=servers\fR, the 
"Webservers" page is \fBPAGE=servers/web\fR and the "Database servers"
page is \fBPAGE=servers/db\fR. Note that you can also use regular expressions 
to specify the page name, e.g. \fBPAGE=%.*/db\fR would find the "Database
servers" page regardless of where this page was placed in the hierarchy.

The top-level page has a the fixed name \fB/\fR, e.g. \fBPAGE=/\fR would 
match all hosts on the Hobbit frontpage. If you need it in a regular
expression, use \fBPAGE=%^/\fR to avoid matching the forward-slash
present in subpage-names.

.sp
.BR "EXPAGE=targetstring"
Rule excluding an alert if the pagename matches.
.sp
.BR "HOST=targetstring"
Rule matching an alert by the hostname.
.sp
.BR "EXHOST=targetstring"
Rule excluding an alert by matching the hostname.
.sp
.BR "TIME=timespecification"
Rule matching an alert by the time-of-day. This is specified as the DOWNTIME timespecification in the bb-hosts file.

The "targetstring" is either a simple pagename, hostname or servicename, OR a '%' followed by a Perl-compatible regular expression. E.g. "HOST=%www(.*)" will match any hostname that begins with "www".
