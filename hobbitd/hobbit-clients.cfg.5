.TH HOBBIT-CLIENTS.CFG 5 "Version 4.1.2: 11 Oct 2005" "Hobbit Monitor"
.SH NAME
hobbit-clients.cfg \- Configuration file for the hobbitd_client module

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ~hobbit/server/etc/hobbit-clients.cfg

.SH DESCRIPTION
The hobbit-clients.cfg file controls what color is assigned to
the status-messages that are generated from the Hobbit client
data - typically the cpu, disk, memory, procs- and msgs-columns. Color
is decided on the basis of some \fBsettings\fR defined in this file;
settings apply to specific hosts through a set of \fBrules\fR.

Note: This file is only used on the Hobbit server - it is not
used by the Hobbit client, so there is no need to distribute
it to your client systems.

.SH FILE FORMAT
Blank lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are treated as 
comments and ignored. 


.SH CPU STATUS COLUMN SETTINGS
.sp
.BR "LOAD warnlevel paniclevel"
.sp
If the system load exceeds "warnlevel" or "paniclevel", the "cpu"
status will go yellow or red, respectively. These are decimal
numbers.
.sp
Defaults: warnlevel=5.0, paniclevel=10.0
.sp
.BR "UP bootlimit toolonglimit"
.sp
The cpu status goes yellow if the system has been up for less than
"bootlimit" time, or longer than "toolonglimit". The time is in
minutes, or you can add h/d/w for hours/days/weeks - eg. "2h" for
two hours, or "4w" for 4 weeks.
.sp
Defaults: bootlimit=1h, toolonglimit=-1 (infinite).
.sp
Example: Go yellow if the load average exceeds 5, and red if it
exceeds 10. Also, go yellow for 10 minutes after a reboot, and after 
4 weeks uptime.
.IP
.nf
LOAD 5 10
UP 10m 4w
.fi
.LP

.SH DISK STATUS COLUMN SETTINGS
.sp
.BR "DISK filesystem warnlevel paniclevel"
.sp
If the utilization of "filesystem" is reported to exceed "warnlevel"
or "paniclevel", the "disk" status will go yellow or red, respectively.
"warnlevel" and "paniclevel" are the percentage filled.
"filesystem" is the mount-point where the filesystem is mounted, e.g.
"/usr" or "/home". A filesystem-name that begins with "%" is interpreted
as a Perl-compatible regular expression; e.g. "%^/oracle.*/" will match
any filesystem whose mountpoint begins with "/oracle".
.sp
Defaults: warnlevel=90, paniclevel=95

.SH MEMORY STATUS COLUMN SETTINGS
.sp
.BR "MEMPHYS warnlevel paniclevel"
.br
.BR "MEMACT warnlevel paniclevel"
.br
.BR "MEMSWAP warnlevel paniclevel"
.sp
If the memory utilization exceeds the "warnlevel" or "paniclevel", the
"memory" status will change to yellow or red, respectively.
Note: The words "PHYS", "ACT" and "SWAP" are also recognized.
.sp
Example: Go yellow if more than 20% swap is used, and red if
more than 40% swap is used or the actual memory utilisation exceeds
90%. Dont alert on physical memory usage.
.IP
.nf
MEMSWAP 20 40
MEMACT 90 90
MEMPHYS 101 101
.fi
.LP
Defaults:
.IP
.nf
MEMPHYS warnlevel=100 paniclevel=101 (i.e. it will never go red).
MEMSWAP warnlevel=50 paniclevel=80
MEMACT  warnlevel=90 paniclevel=97
.fi
.LP

.SH PROCS STATUS COLUMN SETTINGS
.sp
.BR "PROC processname minimumcount maximumcount color"
.sp
The "ps" listing sent by the client will be scanned for how many
processes containing "processname" are running, and this is then
matched against the min/max settings defined here. If the running
count is outside the thresholds, the color of the "procs" status
changes to "color".
.sp
To check for a process that must NOT be running: Set minimum and
maximum to 0.
.sp
"processname" can be a simple string, in which case this string must
show up in the "ps" listing as a command. The scanner will find
a ps-listing of e.g. "/usr/sbin/cron" if you only specify "processname"
as "cron".
"processname" can also be a Perl-compatiable regular expression, e.g.
"%java.*inst[0123]" can be used to find entries in the ps-listing for
"java -Xmx512m inst2" and "java -Xmx256 inst3". In that case,
"processname" must begin with "%" followed by the reg.expression.
If "processname" contains whitespace (blanks or TAB), you must enclose
the full string in double quotes - including the "%" if you use regular
expression matching. E.g.
.sp
    PROC "%hobbitd_channel --channel=data.*hobbitd_rrd" 1 1 yellow
.sp
or
.sp
    PROC "java -DCLASSPATH=/opt/java/lib" 2 5
.sp
You can have multiple "PROC" entries for the same host, all of the
checks are merged into the "procs" status and the most severe
check defines the color of the status.
.sp
Example: Check that "cron" is running:
.br
	PROC cron
.sp
Example: Check that at least 5 "httpd" processes are running, but not more than 20:
.br
	PROC httpd 5 20
.sp
Defaults:
.br
	mincount=1, maxcount=-1 (unlimited), color="red".
.br
	Note that no processes are checked by default.

.SH MSGS STATUS COLUMN SETTINGS
.sp
.BR "LOG logfilename pattern [color [excludepattern]]"
.sp
The Hobbit client extracts interesting lines from one or 
more logfiles - see the
.I client-local.cfg(5)
man-page for information about how to configure which
logs a client should look at.
.sp
The \fBLOG\fR setting determine how these extracts of log entries
are processed, and what warnings or alerts trigger as a result.
.sp
"logfilename" is the base name of the logfile (without any directory).
Only logentries from this filename will be matched against this rule.
Note that "logfilename" can be a regular expression.
.sp
"pattern" is a string or regular expression. If the logfile data matches 
"pattern", it will trigger the "msgs" column to change color. If
no "color" parameter is present, the default is to go "red" when
the pattern is matched. To match against a regular expression, "pattern"
must begin with a "%" sign - e.g "%WARNING|NOTICE" will match any lines
containing either of these two words.
.sp
"excludepattern" is a string or regular expression that can be used to 
filter out any unwanted strings that happen to match "pattern".
.sp
Example: Trigger a red alert when the string "ERROR" appears in the "syslog" file:
.br
	LOG syslog ERROR
.sp
Example: Trigger a yellow warning on all occurrences of the word "WARNING"
or "NOTICE" in the "daemon.log" file, except those from the "lpr" system:
.br
	LOG daemon.log %WARNING|NOTICE yellow lpr
.sp
Defaults:
.br
	color="red", no "excludepattern".
.sp
Note that no logfiles are checked by default. Any log
data reported by a client will just show up on the "msgs"
column with status OK (green).



.SH CHANGING THE DEFAULT SETTINGS
If you would like to use different defaults for the settings described above, 
then you can define the new defaults after a DEFAULT line. E.g. this would
explicitly define all of the default settings:
.IP
.nf
DEFAULT
	UP      1h
	LOAD    5.0 10.0
	DISK    * 90 95
	MEMPHYS 100 101
	MEMSWAP 50 80
	MEMACT  90 97
.fi
.LP

.SH RULES TO SELECT HOSTS
All of the settings can be applied to a group of hosts, by preceding them with
rules. A rule defines of one of more filters using these keywords (note that
this is identical to the rule definitions used in the
.I hobbit-alerts.cfg(5)
file).

.BR "PAGE=targetstring"
Rule matching an alert by the name of the page in BB. "targetstring" is the path of
the page as defined in the bb-hosts file. E.g. if you have this setup:
.IP
.nf
page servers All Servers
subpage web Webservers
10.0.0.1 www1.foo.com
subpage db Database servers
10.0.0.2 db1.foo.com
.fi
.LP
Then the "All servers" page is found with \fBPAGE=servers\fR, the 
"Webservers" page is \fBPAGE=servers/web\fR and the "Database servers"
page is \fBPAGE=servers/db\fR. Note that you can also use regular expressions 
to specify the page name, e.g. \fBPAGE=%.*/db\fR would find the "Database
servers" page regardless of where this page was placed in the hierarchy.

The top-level page has a the fixed name \fB/\fR, e.g. \fBPAGE=/\fR would 
match all hosts on the Hobbit frontpage. If you need it in a regular
expression, use \fBPAGE=%^/\fR to avoid matching the forward-slash
present in subpage-names.

.BR "EXPAGE=targetstring"
Rule excluding an alert if the pagename matches.

.BR "HOST=targetstring"
Rule matching an alert by the hostname.
"targetstring" is either a comma-separated list of hostnames (from the bb-hosts file),
"*" to indicate "all hosts", or a Perl-compatible regular expression.
E.g. "HOST=dns.foo.com,www.foo.com" identifies two specific hosts;
"HOST=%www.*.foo.com EXHOST=www-test.foo.com" matches all hosts with a name
beginning with "www", except the "www-test" host.

.BR "EXHOST=targetstring"
Rule excluding an alert by matching the hostname.

.BR "TIME=timespecification"
Rule matching an alert by the time-of-day. This is specified as the DOWNTIME 
time specification in the bb-hosts file.  E.g. "TIME=W:0800:2200"
applied to a rule will make this rule active only on week-days between
8AM and 10PM.

.SH RULES: APPLYING SETTINGS TO SELECTED HOSTS
Rules must be placed after the settings, e.g.
.IP
.nf
LOAD 8.0 12.0  HOST=db.foo.com TIME=*:0800:1600
.fi
.LP

If you have multiple settings that you want to apply the same rules to,
you can write the rules *only* on one line, followed by the settings. E.g.
.IP
.nf
HOST=%db.*.foo.com TIME=W:0800:1600
	LOAD 8.0 12.0
	DISK /db  98 100
	PROC mysqld 1
.fi
.LP
will apply the three settings to all of the "db" hosts on week-days between 8AM
and 4PM. This can be combined with per-settings rule, in which case the
per-settings rule overrides the general rule; e.g.
.IP
.nf
HOST=%.*.foo.com
	LOAD 7.0 12.0 HOST=bax.foo.com
	LOAD 3.0 8.0
.fi
.LP
will result in the load-limits being 7.0/12.0 for the "bax.foo.com" host,
and 3.0/8.0 for all other foo.com hosts.

The entire file is evaluated from the top to bottom, and the first
match found is used. So you should put the specific settings first, and
the generic ones last.
