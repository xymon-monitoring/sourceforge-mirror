This directory - the client/sections/ directory - can be used to 
install Xymon client add-on scripts. The Xymon client will run
all files in this directory that are executable, and include the
output from each script in a section in the Xymon client
message which is sent to the Xymon server. Sections will appear 
just like normal client sections.

This directory is intended for use with automatically deployed files. Local
scripts for this host should be placed in the client/local/ directory instead.

This output will have to be processed on the Xymon server; there
is no default processing done by Xymon on the output from these
scripts. They are merely added to the client data.

If you want to install an add-on script that direcly generates a 
status column in Xymon, this should go in the client/ext/ directory
instead.
