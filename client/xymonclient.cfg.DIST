# Local Mode (Only) Options
#
# Running the Xymon client in local-config mode will cause threshold evaluation to
# be performed locally rather than sending raw data sent to the Xymon server for
# analysis. Only the processed results will be forwarded to your Xymon server.
# 
# This can also be overridden by adding a "--local" option to xymonclient.sh in
# the $XYMONHOME/etc/clientlaunch.cfg file

# Message compression
# Xymon clients can compress messages before sending to the xymon server to save on bandwidth.
# This requires version 4.4 of higher of xymond to be running. If using a format other than "lzo",
# the destination server must have been compiled with support for your algorithm.
# 
# If your destination is a xymonproxy, you are running in server-side (non-local) config mode,
# and you are not running in $STATUSMODE, you should NOT enable compression as your client 
# messages will not return a logfetch configuration.
COMPRESSION="TRUE"		# Set to "TRUE" to enable for xymon client processes 
COMPRESSTYPE="lzo"		# Default is "lzo" unless "lz4hc" is available
