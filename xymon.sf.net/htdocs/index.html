<h1>Xymon Monitor</h1>
<blockquote>
Welcome to the Xymon Monitor project homepage. Xymon is a 
system for monitoring servers and networks. It takes its inspiration
from the Big Brother monitoring system, but unlike Big Brother
it is designed to work well whether you need to monitor a small 
network with just a handful of hosts, or large networks with
thousands of servers and network services.
<p>
Xymon is the successor to the <b>bbgen toolkit</b>, which 
has been available as an add-on to Big Brother since late 2002.
The name change was decided upon when Hobbit acquired enough
functionality to be a stand-alone product. The tools that formed
the bbgen toolkit are still present in Hobbit and are quite 
important for it, so if you have used bbgen before Hobbit
will seem quite familiar.
<p>In 2009 the project was renamed to Xymon.</p>

<h3>What does Xymon do ?</h3>

<blockquote>
Xymon monitors your <em>hosts</em>, your <em>network services</em>, 
and <em>anything else</em> you configure it to do via extensions.
Xymon can periodically generate requests to network services -
http, ftp, smtp and so on - and record if the service is responding as
expected. You can also monitor local disk utilisation, logfiles and
processes through the use of agents installed on the servers.
<p>
All of the monitoring results are collected by a central server
and used to build a set of webpages that show the status of your
network, with drill-down functionality to check up on problems.
Xymon will also record the history of each monitored item, so
you can generate availability reports and check on the incidents
that have occurred. Wherever possible data is also stored for trend
analysis and presented as graphs, so you can easily track e.g. the
response-time of a business-critical web application over time.
<p>
In case of problems alerts may be sent in the form of e-mails,
SMS-messages or pager-alerts so that staff can respond quickly to
problems without having to keep watch over the services.
<p>
The easiest way to understand what Xymon does is to see it in
action. <a href="http://www.xymon.com/xymon/">http://www.xymon.com/xymon/</a>
is the live view of a Xymon server that monitors my home network.</p>
