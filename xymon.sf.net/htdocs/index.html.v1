<h1>Hobbit Monitor</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Hobbit Monitor project homepage. Hobbit is a 
system for monitoring servers and networks. It has a great deal 
of inspiration from the Big Brother monitor, but unlike Big Brother
it is designed to work well whether you need to monitor small 
network with just a handful of hosts, or large networks with
thousands of hosts.</p>

<p>Hobbit is the successor to the <b>bbgen toolkit</b>, which 
has been available as an add-on to Big Brother since late 2002.
The name change was decided upon when Hobbit acquired enough
functionality to be a stand-alone product. The tools that formed
the bbgen toolkit are still present in Hobbit and are quite 
important for it, so if you have used bbgen before, Hobbit
will seem quite familiar.</p>

<h3>What does Hobbit do ?</h3>
<p>Hobbit monitors your <em>hosts</em>, your <em>network services</em>, 
and <em>anything else</em> you configure it to do via extensions. Hobbit will
periodically generate requests to network services - http, ftp,
smtp and so on - and record if the service is responding as
expected. Through the use of agents installed on the servers,
you can also monitor local disk utilisation, logfiles and processes.</p>
<p>All of the monitoring results are collected by a central server,
and used to build a set of webpages that show the status of your
network, with drill-down functionality to check up on problems.
Hobbit will also record the history of each monitored item, so
you can generate availability reports and check on the incidents
that have occurred. Wherever it is possible, data is also stored
for trend analysis and presented as graphs, so you can easily 
track e.g. the response-time of a business-critical web application
over time.</p>
<p>In case of problems, alerts may be sent in the form of e-mails,
SMS-messages or pager-alerts, so that staff can respond quickly to
problems without having to keep watch over the services.</p>

<p>The easiest way to understand what Hobbit does is to see it in
action. <a href="http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/">http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/</a>
is the live view of a Hobbit that monitors my home network.</p>
