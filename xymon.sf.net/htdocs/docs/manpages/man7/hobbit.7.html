<H2>NAME</H2>

Hobbit - introduction to the Hobbit Monitor
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OVERVIEW</H2>

Hobbit is a tool for monitoring the health of your networked servers 
and the applications running on them.  It provides a simple, 
intuitive way of checking the health of your systems from 
a webbrowser, and can also alert you to any problems that 
arise through alarms sent as e-mail, SMS messages, via a 
pager or by other means.
<P>
Hobbit is Open Source software, licensed under the GNU GPL.
This means that you are free to use Hobbit as much as you like,
and you are free to re-distribute it and change it to suit 
your specific needs. However, if you change it then you must make 
your changes available to others on the same terms that you 
received Hobbit originally. See the file COPYING in the Hobbit
source-archive for details.
<P>
Hobbit initially began life as an enhancement to Big Brother called 
&quot;bbgen&quot;. Over a period of 5 years, Hobbit has evolved from a small
add-on to a full-fledged monitoring system with capabilities far
exceeding what was in the original Big Brother package. Hobbit
does still maintain some compatibility with Big Brother, so it
is possible to migrate from Big Brother to Hobbit without too
much trouble. 
<P>
Migrating to Hobbit will give you a significant performance boost, 
and provide you with much more advanced monitoring.  The Hobbit tools 
are designed for installations that need to monitor a large number 
of hosts, with very little overhead on the monitoring server. 
Monitoring of thousands of hosts with a single Hobbit server is 
possible - it was developed to handle just this task.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FEATURES</H2>

These are some of the core features in Hobbit:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Monitoring of hosts and networks<DD>
Hobbit collects information about your systems in two ways: From
querying network services (Web, LDAP, DNS, Mail etc.), or from
scripts that run either on the Hobbit server or on the systems 
you monitor. The Hobbit package includes a Hobbit client
which you can install on the servers you monitor; it collects
data about the CPU-load, disk- and memory-utilisation, logfiles,
network ports in use, file- and directory-information and more.
All of the information is stored inside Hobbit, and you can define
conditions that result in alerts, e.g. if a network service stops
responding, or a disk fills up.
<P>
<P>
<DT>Centralized configuration<DD>
All configuration of Hobbit is done on the Hobbit server. Even when
monitoring hundreds or thousands of hosts, you can control their
configuration centrally on the Hobbit server - so there is no need 
for you to login to a system just to change e.g. which processes are
monitored.
<P>
<P>
<DT>Works on all major platforms<DD>
The Hobbit server works on all Unix-like systems, including Linux,
Solaris, FreeBSD, AIX, HP-UX and others. The Hobbit client supports
all major Unix platforms, and there are other Open Source projects
- e.g. BBWin, see <A HREF="http://bbwin.sourceforge.net/">http://bbwin.sourceforge.net/</A> - providing support for 
Microsoft Windows based systems.
<P>
<P>
<DT>A simple, intuitive web-based front-end<DD>
&quot;Green is good, red is bad&quot;. Using the Hobbit webpages is as simple
as that. The hosts you monitor can be grouped together in a way that
makes sense in your organisation and presented in a tree-structure.
The webpages use many techniques to convey information about the monitored
systems, e.g. different icons can be used for recently changed statuses;
links to subpages can be listed in multiple columns; different icons
can be used for dialup-tests or reverse-tests; selected columns
can be dropped or unconditionally included on the webpages to
eliminate unwanted information, or always include certain information;
user-friendly names can be shown for hosts regardless of their true
hostname. You can also have automatic links to on-line documentation, 
so information about your critical systems is just a click away.
<P>
<P>
<DT>Integrated trend analysis, historical data and SLA reporting<DD>
Hobbit stores trend- and availability-information about everything 
it monitors. So if you need to look at how your systems behave over
time, Hobbit has all of the information you need: Whether is is response 
times of your webpages during peak hours, the CPU utilisation over the 
past 4 weeks, or what the availability of a site was compared to the
SLA - it's all there inside Hobbit. All measurements are tracked
and made available in time-based graphs.
<P>
When you need to drill down into events that have occurred, Hobbit
provides a powerful tool for viewing the event history for each
statuslog, with overviews of when problems have occurred during the
past and easy-to-use zoom-in on the event.
<P>
For SLA reporting, You can configure planned downtime, agreed service 
availability level, service availability time and have Hobbit generate 
availability reports directly showing the actual availability measured 
against the agreed SLA. Such reports of service availability can be 
generated on-the-fly, or pre-generated e.g. for monthly reporting. 
<P>
<P>
<DT>Role-based views<DD>
You can have multiple different views of the same hosts for different
parts of the organisation, e.g. one view for the hardware group,
and another view for the webmasters - all of them fed by the same
test tools.
<P>
If you have a dedicated Network Operations Centre, you can configure 
precisely which alerts will appear on their monitors - e.g. a simple 
anomaly in the system logfile need not trigger a call to 3rd-level 
support at 2 AM, but if the on-line shop goes down you do want someone
to respond immediately.  So you put the webcheck for the on-line shop 
on the NOC monitor page, and leave out the log-file check.
<P>
<P>
<DT>Also for the techies<DD>
The Hobbit user-interface is simple, but engineers will also find
lots of relevant information. E.g. the data that clients report to Hobbit
contain the raw output from a number of system commands.  That information 
is available directly in Hobbit, so an administrator no longer needs to 
login to a server to get an overview of how it is behaving - the very 
commands they would normally run have alredy been performed, and the 
results are on-line in Hobbit.
<P>
<P>
<DT>Easy to adapt to your needs<DD>
Hobbit includes a lot of tests in the core package, but there will
always be something specific to your setup that you would like to
watch. Hobbit allows you to write test scripts in your favourite
scripting language and have the results show up as regular status
columns in Hobbit. You can trigger alerts from these, and even track
trends in graphs just by a simple configuration setting.
<P>
<P>
<DT>Real network service tests<DD>
The network test tool knows how to test most commonly used protocols,
including HTTP, SMTP (e-mail), DNS, LDAP (directory services), and 
many more. When checking websites, it is possible to not only check
that the webserver is responding, but also that the response looks
correct by matching the response against a pre-defined pattern or a
checksum. So you can test that a network service is really working
and supplying the data you expect - not just that the service is
running.
<P>
Protocols that use SSL encryption such as https-websites are fully supported, 
and while checking such services the network tester will automatically run a 
check of the validity of the SSL server certificate, and warn about 
certificates that are about to expire.
<P>
<P>
<DT>Highly configurable alerts<DD>
You want to know when something breaks. But you don't want to get flooded
with alerts all the time. Hobbit lets you define several criteria for
when to send out an alert, so you only get alerts when there is really
something that needs your attention right away. While you are handling
an incident, you can tell Hobbit about it so it stops sending more alerts,
and so that everyone else can check with Hobbit and know that the problem
is being taken care of.
<P>
<P>
<DT>Combined super-tests and test interdependencies<DD>
If a single test is not enough, combination tests can be defined
that combine the result of several tests to a single status-report.
So if you need to monitor that at least 3 out of 5 servers are
running at any time, Hobbit can do that for you and generate
the necessary availability report.
<P>
Tests can also be configured to depend on each other, so that
when a critical router goes down you will get alerts only for
the router - and not from the 200 hosts behind the router.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SECURITY</H2>

All of the Hobbit server tools run under an unprivileged user account.
A single program - the
<I><A HREF="../man1/hobbitping.1.html">hobbitping</A>(1)</I>

network connectivity tester - must be installed setuid-root, but has
been written so that it drops all root privileges immediately after
performing the operation that requires root privileges.
<P>
It is recommended that you setup a dedicated account for Hobbit.
<P>
Communications between the Hobbit server and Hobbit clients use the
Big Brother TCP port 1984. If the Hobbit server is located behind
a firewall, it must allow for inbound connections to the Hobbit 
server on tcp port 1984. Normally, Hobbit clients - i.e. the servers
you are monitoring - must be permitted to connect to the Hobbit server 
on this port. However, if that is not possible due to firewall 
policies, then Hobbit includes the
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbitfetch.8.html">hobbitfetch</A>(8)</I>

and
<I><A HREF="../man8/msgcache.8.html">msgcache</A>(8)</I>

tools to allows for a pull-style way of collecting data, where it 
is the Hobbit server that initiates connections to the clients.
<P>
The Hobbit webpages are dynamically generated through CGI programs.
<P>
Access to the Hobbit webpages is controlled through your webserver
access controls, e.g. you can require a login through some form of
HTTP authentication.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DEMONSTRATION SITE</H2>

A site running this software can be seen at <A HREF="http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/">http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/</A>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PREREQUISITES AND INSTALLATION</H2>

You will need a Unix-like system (Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX,
FreeBSD, Mac OS X or similar) with a webserver installed. You
will also need a C compiler and som additional libraries, but
many systems come with the required development tools and 
libraries pre-installed. The required libraries are:
<P>
<B>RRDtool</B>

This library is used to store and present trend-data. It is required.
<P>
<B>libpcre</B>

This library is used for advanced pattern-matching of text strings
in configuration files. This library is required.
<P>
<B>OpenSSL</B>

This library is used for communication with SSL-enabled network services.
Although optional, it is recommended that you install this for Hobbit
since many network tests do use SSL.
<P>
<B>OpenLDAP</B>

This library is used for testing LDAP servers. Use of this is optional.
<P>
For more detailed information about Hobbit system requirements and
how to install Hobbit, refer to the online documentation &quot;Installing
Hobbit&quot; available from the Hobbit webserver (via the &quot;Help&quot; menu),
or from the &quot;docs/install.html&quot; file in the Hobbit source archive.

<H2>HOBBIT SERVER TOOLS</H2>

These tools implement the core functionality of the Hobbit server:
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbitd.8.html">hobbitd</A>(8)</I>

is the core daemon that collects all reports about the status of 
your hosts. It uses a number of helper modules to
implement certain tasks such as updating logfiles and sending
out alerts: hobbitd_client, hobbitd_history, hobbitd_alert
and hobbitd_rrd. There is also a hobbitd_filestore module for
compatibility with Big Brother.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbitd_channel.8.html">hobbitd_channel</A>(8)</I>

Implements the communication between the Hobbit daemon and the
other Hobbit server modules.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbitd_history.8.html">hobbitd_history</A>(8)</I>

Stores historical data about the things that Hobbit monitors.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbitd_rrd.8.html">hobbitd_rrd</A>(8)</I>

Stores trend data, which is used to generate graphs of the data
monitored by Hobbit.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbitd_alert.8.html">hobbitd_alert</A>(8)</I>

handles alerts. When a status changes to a critical state, this 
module decides if an alert should be sent out, and to whom.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbitd_client.8.html">hobbitd_client</A>(8)</I>

handles data collected by the Hobbit clients, analyzes the data
and feeds back several status updates to Hobbit to build the
view of the client status.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbitd_hostdata.8.html">hobbitd_hostdata</A>(8)</I>

stores historical client data when something breaks. E.g. when a
webpage stops responding hobbitd_hostdata will save the latest
client data, so that you can use this to view a snapshot of how
the system state was just prior to it failing.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HOBBIT NETWORK TEST TOOLS</H2>

These tools are used on servers that execute tests of network services.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/hobbitping.1.html">hobbitping</A>(1)</I>

performs network connectivity (ping) tests.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bbtest-net.1.html">bbtest-net</A>(1)</I>

runs the network service tests.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bbretest-net.sh.1.html">bbretest-net.sh</A>(1)</I>

is an extension script for re-doing failed network tests with a higher 
frequency than the normal network tests. This allows Hobbit to pick up
the recovery of a network service as soon as it happens, resulting in 
less downtime being recorded.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HOBBIT TOOLS HANDLING THE WEB USER-INTERFACE</H2>

These tools take care of generating and updating the various
Hobbit web-pages.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bbgen.1.html">bbgen</A>(1)</I>

takes care of updating the Hobbit webpages.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/hobbitsvc.cgi.1.html">hobbitsvc.cgi</A>(1)</I>

This CGI program generates an HTML view of a single status log.
It is used to present the Hobbit status-logs.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/hobbitgraph.cgi.1.html">hobbitgraph.cgi</A>(1)</I>

This CGI program generates graphs of the trend-data collected
by Hobbit.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/hobbit-hostgraphs.cgi.1.html">hobbit-hostgraphs.cgi</A>(1)</I>

When you want to combine multiple graphs into one, this CGI lets
you combine graphs so you can e.g. compare the load on all of the
nodes in your server farm.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/hobbit-nkview.cgi.1.html">hobbit-nkview.cgi</A>(1)</I>

Generates the Critical Systems view, based on the currently critical
systems and the configuration of what systems and services you want to 
monitor when.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bb-hist.cgi.1.html">bb-hist.cgi</A>(1)</I>

This CGI program generates a webpage with the most recent history 
of a particular host+service combination.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bb-eventlog.cgi.1.html">bb-eventlog.cgi</A>(1)</I>

This CGI lets you view a log of events that have happened over a period 
of time, for a single host or test, or for multiple systems.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bb-ack.cgi.1.html">bb-ack.cgi</A>(1)</I>

This CGI program allows a user to acknowledge an alert he received
from Hobbit about a host that is in a critical state. Acknowledging
an alert serves two purposes: First, it stops more alerts from being
sent so the technicians are not bothered wit more alerts, and secondly
it provides feedback to those looking at the Hobbit webpages that the
problem is being handled.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbit-mailack.8.html">hobbit-mailack</A>(8)</I>

is a tool for processing acknowledgements sent via e-mail, e.g. as a 
response to an e-mail alert.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbit-enadis.cgi.8.html">hobbit-enadis.cgi</A>(8)</I>

is a CGI program to disable or re-enable hosts or individual tests.
When disabling a host or test, you stop alarms from being sent and
also any outages do not affect the SLA calculations. So this tool
is useful when systems are being brought down for maintenance.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bb-findhost.cgi.1.html">bb-findhost.cgi</A>(1)</I>

is a CGI program that finds a given host in the Hobbit
webpages. As your Hobbit installation grows, it can become
difficult to remember exactly which page a host is on; this CGI
script lets you find hosts easily.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bb-rep.cgi.1.html">bb-rep.cgi</A>(1)</I>

This CGI program triggers the generation of Hobbit availability 
reports, using
<I><A HREF="../man1/bbgen.1.html">bbgen</A>(1)</I>

as the reporting back-end engine.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bb-replog.cgi.1.html">bb-replog.cgi</A>(1)</I>

This CGI program generates the detailed availability report for a 
particular host+service combination.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bb-snapshot.cgi.1.html">bb-snapshot.cgi</A>(1)</I>

is a CGI program to build the Hobbit webpages in a &quot;snapshot&quot;
mode, showing the look of the webpages at a particular point 
in time. It uses
<I><A HREF="../man1/bbgen.1.html">bbgen</A>(1)</I>

as the back-end engine.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/hobbit-statusreport.cgi.1.html">hobbit-statusreport.cgi</A>(1)</I>

is a CGI program reporting test results for a single status but
for several hosts. It is used to e.g. see which SSL certificates
are about to expire, across all of the Hobbit webpages.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bb-csvinfo.cgi.1.html">bb-csvinfo.cgi</A>(1)</I>

is a CGI program to present information about a host. The 
information is pulled from a CSV (Comma Separated Values)
file, which is easily exported from any spreadsheet or
database program.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CLIENT-SIDE TOOLS</H2>

<I><A HREF="../man1/logfetch.1.html">logfetch</A>(1)</I>

is a utility used by the Hobbit Unix client to collect
information from logfiles on the client. It can also monitor various
other file-related data, e.g. file metadata or directory sizes.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/clientupdate.1.html">clientupdate</A>(1)</I>

Is used on Hobbit clients, to automatically update the client software
with new versions. Through this tool, updates of the client software
can happen without an administrator having to logon to the server.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man8/msgcache.8.html">msgcache</A>(8)</I>

This tool acts as a mini Hobbit server to the client. It stores client
data internally, so that the
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbitfetch.8.html">hobbitfetch</A>(8)</I>

utility can pick it up later and send it to the Hobbit server. It
is typically used on hosts that cannot contact the Hobbit server 
directly due to network- or firewall-restrictions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HOBBIT COMMUNICATION TOOLS</H2>

These tools are used for communications between the Hobbit server
and the Hobbit clients. If there are no firewalls then they are not
needed, but it may be necessary due to network or firewall issues
to make use of them.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man8/bbproxy.8.html">bbproxy</A>(8)</I>

is a proxy-server that forwards Hobbit messages between
clients and the Hobbit server. The clients must be able to talk
to the proxy, and the proxy must be able to talk to the Hobbit
server.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbitfetch.8.html">hobbitfetch</A>(8)</I>

is used when the client is not able to make outbound connections
to neither bbproxy nor the Hobbit server (typically, for clients
located in a DMZ network zone). Together with the
<I><A HREF="../man8/msgcache.8.html">msgcache</A>(8)</I>

utility running on the client, the Hobbit server can contact the
clients and pick up their data.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OTHER TOOLS</H2>

<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbitlaunch.8.html">hobbitlaunch</A>(8)</I>

is a program scheduler for Hobbit. It acts as a master program
for running all of the Hobbit tools on a system. On the Hobbit
server, it controls running all of the server tasks. On a Hobbit
client, it periodically launches the client to collect data
and send them to the Hobbit server.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bb.1.html">bb</A>(1)</I>

is the tool used to communicate with the Hobbit server.
It is used to send status reports to the Hobbit server,
through the custom Hobbit/BB protocol, or via HTTP. It
can be used to query the state of tests on the central Hobbit 
server and retrieve Hobbit configuration files. The server-side 
script 
<I><A HREF="../man1/bbmessage.cgi.1.html">bbmessage.cgi</A>(1) </I>

used to receive messages sent via HTTP is also included.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bbcmd.1.html">bbcmd</A>(1)</I>

is a wrapper for the other Hobbit tools which sets up all
of the environment variables used by Hobbit tools.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bbhostgrep.1.html">bbhostgrep</A>(1)</I>

is a utility for use by Hobbit extension scripts. It
allows an extension script to easily pick out the hosts that
are relevant to a script, so it need not parse a huge
bb-hosts file with lots of unwanted test-specifications.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bbhostshow.1.html">bbhostshow</A>(1)</I>

is a utility to dump the full
<I><A HREF="../man5/bb-hosts.5.html">bb-hosts</A>(5)</I>

file following any &quot;include&quot; statements.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bbdigest.1.html">bbdigest</A>(1)</I>

is a utility to compute message digest values for use in
content checks that use digests.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man1/bbcombotest.1.html">bbcombotest</A>(1)</I>

is an extension script for the Hobbit server,
allowing you to build complicated tests from simpler
Hobbit test results. E.g. you can define a test that uses the results
from testing your webserver, database server and router to have a 
single test showing the availability of your enterprise web
application.
<P>
<I><A HREF="../man8/trimhistory.8.html">trimhistory</A>(8)</I>

is a tool to trim the Hobbit history logs. It will remove all
log entries and optionally also the individual status-logs for
events that happened before a given time.

<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

Version 1 of bbgen was relased in November 2002, and optimized the
webpage generation on Big Brother servers.
<P>
Version 2 of bbgen was released in April 2003, and added a tool
for performing network tests.
<P>
Version 3 of bbgen was released in September 2004, and eliminated the 
use of several external libraries for network tests, resulting in a 
significant performance improvement.
<P>
With version 4.0 released on March 30 2005, the project was de-coupled 
from Big Brother, and the name changed to Hobbit. This version was the 
first full implementation of the Hobbit server, but it still used the
data collected by Big Brother clients for monitoring host metrics.
<P>
Version 4.1 was released in July 2005 included a simple Hobbit client
for Unix. Logfile monitoring was not implemented.
<P>
Version 4.2 was released in July 2006, and includes a fully functional
Hobbit client for Unix.
