Description: monitoring system for systems, networks and applications
 Hobbit is a network- and applications-monitoring system designed
 for use in large-scale networks. But it will also work just fine
 on a small network with just a few nodes. It is low-overhead and
 high-performance, with an easy to use web front-end. It handles
 monitoring of network services, and through client packages it
 can also be used to monitor server-specific items. Alerts can
 trigger when monitoring detects a problem, resulting in e-mails
 or calls to your pager or mobile phone.
 .
 Hobbit has a great deal of inspiration from the non-free Big Brother 
 package, but does not include any Big Brother code.

Description: client for the Hobbit network monitor
 Client data collection package for Hobbit. This gathers

 it to the Hobbit monitor. You should run this on all
 systems if you have a Hobbit server installed.
