	ALPHA RELEASE -- NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE

Note: For previous release notes, see RELEASENOTES-4.3 file.


Xymon 4.4 represents a large number of changes from 4.3 for administrators,
however most users should notice little distinction in day-to-day usage.

Among the many new features introduced are:

- IPv6 support for testing and communication
- message compression, using zlib, LZO, or LZ4 algorithms
- significant performance improvements to xymond and client
  algorithms (regressions expected in alpha)
- more flexibility in deployment and more consistent configuragion
- hooks for SELinux compatibility systemd launching, tmpfs xymongen
  destinations, rrdcached usage, and much more


See the Changes file for a more detailed list. See the README files for
broader discussion on various topics (such as compression and the backfeed
queue).


Note: This is an alpha release. Known issues will be listed below or 
available on the xymon website (http://xymon.sourceforge.net/).




XYMON 4.4 ALPHA 1 RELEASE NOTES
===============================

By default, xymon sends using non-backwards compatible message format
(the size of the remaining message is prefixed). To send from a 4.4 client
to a 4.3 or below server, add the following to your environment:

	XYMONV4SERVER=1

This can be added in xymonclient.cfg, xymonserver.cfg, 
/etc/sysconfig/xymon-client or any other location where the sending 
process will have it set. This may change for the final release.
