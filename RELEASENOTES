	ALPHA RELEASE -- NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE

Note: For previous release notes, see RELEASENOTES-4.3 file.


Xymon 4.4 represents a large number of changes from 4.3 for administrators,
however most users should notice little distinction in day-to-day usage.

Among the many new features introduced are:

- IPv6 support for testing and communication
- message compression, using zlib, LZO, or LZ4 algorithms
- significant performance improvements to xymond and client
  algorithms (regressions expected in alpha)
- more flexibility in deployment and more consistent configuragion
- hooks for SELinux compatibility systemd launching, tmpfs xymongen
  destinations, rrdcached usage, and much more


See the Changes file for a more detailed list. See the README files for
broader discussion on various topics (such as compression and the backfeed
queue).


Note: This is an alpha release. Known issues will be listed below or 
available on the xymon website (http://xymon.sourceforge.net/).




XYMON 4.4 ALPHA 1 RELEASE NOTES
===============================

By default, xymon sends using the existing, compatible message format used
by all previous versions (and Big Brother). To send using the "V5" format
(the size of the remaining message is prefixed, allowing truncated messages
to be rejected, and possibly future improvements later on), add the following 
to your environment:

XYMONV5SERVER=TRUE

This can be added in xymonclient.cfg, xymonserver.cfg, 
/etc/sysconfig/xymon-client or any other location where the sending 
process will have it set. This may change for the final release.


(Note: Previous trunk versions had an inverted version of this logic, requiring
XYMONV4SERVER=1 to send to an older server.)
