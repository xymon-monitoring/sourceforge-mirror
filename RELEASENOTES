           * * *   Release notes for Hobbit 4.2    * * *
          <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This release contains several new programs, enhanced functionality
and changes to the configuration files.

New Critical Systems View
=========================
The "Critical Systems" view is now built dynamically by a new
CGI tool, hobbit-nkview. It uses a new configuration file
separate from the bb-hosts file, which is maintained by the
hobbit-nkedit CGI.

 *** The "NK" tags in bb-hosts are being deprecated ***

The NK tags in the bb-hosts file will only be handled in
Hobbit 4.x. It is recommended that you begin to move your
critical systems view to the new hobbit-nkview configuration.


Installation
============
Follow the normal procedure for building and installing Hobbit,
i.e. "./configure; make; make install". Note that Hobbit
now installs three programs suid-root: hobbitping, logfetch
and clientupdate. hobbitping must be suid-root; the others
can work without being suid-root - see their man-pages for
more information.

Hobbit 4.2 uses one more IPC communication channel than the 
previous release (for a total of 8 shared memory segments, and
8 semaphore sets of 3 semaphores each). If your system has a 
limited number of IPC shared-memory segments and/or semaphores, 
you may need to increase this. See the installation document at 
docs/install.html for some information about this, or refer to 
your operating system documentation on System V IPC.


bbproxy upgrade
===============
If you have a multi-host setup using the bbproxy utility, then
you must upgrade bbproxy for the new Hobbit clients to be fully
functional.


Configuration file changes
==========================
If you are upgrading from a previous version of Hobbit, you will
need to merge several new configuration items into your Hobbit
configuration files, in order to make full use of these enhance-
ments. These notes describe what changes to perform.


hobbitserver.cfg
----------------
Several new status columns are being reported by the Hobbit client,
and these have associated graphs. In order for them to show up
correctly, you must change the two graph-settings:
- TEST2RRD: Add ",files,procs=processes,ports,clock,lines" to 
  the current setting.
- GRAPHS: Add ",files,processes,ports,ifstat,clock,lines" to 
  the current setting.

Hobbit now includes a ping utility, which is faster than "fping"
which was used in previous Hobbit versions. To use this utility,
change the FPING setting to FPING="hobbitping". However, the
hobbitping utility is still somewhat experimental, so if you
run into problems with the connectivity tests, it is advised that
you use fping instead.

The following settings in hobbitserver.cfg are no longer used
and may be deleted: BBPAGE, BBPAGERS, USEHOBBITD, PAGELEVELS,
PURPLEDELAY, BBREL, BBRELDATE, CLIENTSVCS.


hobbitcgi.cfg
-------------
Three new CGI programs have been added in Hobbit 4.2. To ensure
they are invoked correctly, add these lines to your hobbitcgi.cfg file:

# hobbitgraph.cgi options
CGI_HOSTGRAPHS_OPTS="--env=/home/hobbit/server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg"
# hobbit-nkview.cgi options
CGI_NKVIEW_OPTS="--env=/home/hobbit/server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg"
# hobbit-nkedit.cgi options
CGI_NKEDIT_OPTS="--env=/home/hobbit/server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg"
# hobbit-ackinfo.cgi options
CGI_ACKINFO_OPTS="--env=/home/hobbit/server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg"

(Replace "/home/hobbit" with the top-level directory of your
Hobbit server installation).


hobbitgraph.cfg
---------------
Several new graphs require additions to the hobbitgraph.cfg
file. If you haven't added any custom graphs, it is recommended
that you install the new version of the file located in the
hobbit-4.2/hobbitd/etcfiles/ directory. If you have added custom
graphs, copy the following sections from the 4.2 version of the
file to your hobbitgraph.cfg file: apache3-multi, conn-multi,
ifstat, files, processes, ports, clock, lines. 


hobbitlaunch.cfg
----------------
The path for the [bbcombotest] module was incorrect. To use the
bbcombotest feature, make sure that it has
   CMD BBHOME/bin/bbcombotest

A new Hobbit module has been implemented, which saves a snapshot
of the client data reported by a Hobbit client prior to a status
going into a critical or warning state. This aids in diagnosing
problems where the critical status appearing in Hobbit is only
a symptom of the real problem, and you need to look at other types
of data to determine the root cause. To enable this module, two
changes are needed:

- The [hobbitd] command must have the option "--store-clientlogs=!msgs"
  added. See the hobbitd(8) man-page for further information.
- A new [hostdata] section must be added:
  # "hostdata" stores the Hobbit client messages on disk when some status for a host
  # changes. This lets you access a lot of data collected from a host around the time
  # when a problem occurred. However, it may use a significant amount of disk space
  # if you have lots of Hobbit clients.
  # Note: The --store-clientlogs option for the [hobbitd] provides control over
  #       which status-changes will cause a client message to be stored.
  [hostdata]
         ENVFILE $BBHOME/etc/hobbitserver.cfg
         NEEDS hobbitd
         CMD hobbitd_channel --channel=clichg --log=$BBSERVERLOGS/hostdata.log hobbitd_hostdata


~hobbit/server/www/menu/menu_items.js
-----------------------------------
Two new menu items have been added, and the "NK view" has been replaced by
the new "Critical systems" view. To make this visible, change this:
- Replace the "NK view" section with
      ['Critical systems', '/hobbit-cgi/hobbit-nkview.sh'],
  Note that this requires you to migrate your current "NK" tags in
  the bb-hosts file to the new Critical Systems configuration file.
  See the "Critical Systems" menu item in the "Help" menu.
- In the "Reports" menu, after the "Config report" line, add
      ['Metrics Report', '/hobbit-cgi/hobbit-hostgraphs.sh'],
      ['Ghost Clients', '/hobbit-cgi/hobbit-ghosts.sh'],
- In the "Administration" menu, after the "Enable/Disable" line, add
      ['Edit critical systems', '/hobbit-seccgi/hobbit-nkedit.sh'],
- In the "Help" menu, after the "Tips and Tricks" line, add
      ['Custom graphs', '/hobbit/help/howtograph.html'],
- In the "Help" menu, after the "Configuring Alerts" line, add
      ['Critical systems', '/hobbit/help/criticalsystems.html'],
      ['Custom graphs', '/hobbit/help/howtograph.html'],
The "/hobbit-cgi" part of the URL may be different, depending on your setup.


~hobbit/server/www/menu/menu_tpl.js
---------------------------------
The width of menu items need to be increased slightly. Change line 25
of this file from "'width': 150" to "'width': 160".


bb-services
-----------
The [spamd] definition had an erroneous "expect" string. It should
be changed to
   expect "SPAMD"

A "cupsd" definition has been added to test the CUPS printing system.
# CUPS print server. It answers to HTTP requests.
[cupsd]
   send "GET /printers\r\n"
   expect "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
   port 631

And an "AJP13" definition has been added for the Apache JServer 
protocol version 1.3.
# AJP (Apache JServ Protocol) 1.3 - sends an AJP "ping" request.
# Ref: http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/common/ajpv13a.html
# From Charles Goyard
[ajp13]
   send "\x12\x34\x00\x01\x0a"
   expect "\x41\x42\x00\x01\x09"
   port 8009
