	ALPHA RELEASE -- NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE

Note: For previous release notes, see RELEASENOTES-4.3 file.


Xymon 4.4 represents a large number of changes from 4.3 for administrators,
however most users should notice little distinction in day-to-day usage.

Among the many new features introduced are:

- IPv6 support for testing and communication
- SSL support for submission and/or client authentication
- message compression, using zlib, LZO, or LZ4 algorithms
- significant performance improvements to xymond and client
  algorithms (regressions expected in alpha)
- more flexibility in deployment and more consistent configuragion
- hooks for SELinux compatibility systemd launching, tmpfs xymongen
  destinations, rrdcached usage, and much more


See the Changes file for a more detailed list. See the README files for
broader discussion on various topics (such as compression and the backfeed
queue).


Note: This is an alpha release. Known issues will be listed below or 
available on the xymon website (http://xymon.sourceforge.net/).




XYMON 4.4 ALPHA 1 KNOWN ISSUES AND RELEASE NOTES
================================================

Carefuly examine all apache config files for customizations. New snippets have
been added for specifying report and snapshot subdirectories in the WWW root.

Crashes of any xymon components (and there may be several) will be reported
under the "xymond" test. Singular crashes will be overwritten and no longer 
need to be dropped manually as a spurious test. Recurring crashed will alert
under xymond.

The "backfeed queue" is not enabled by default in xymond to facilitate 
network stack testing, but will likely be turned on for the final release.
Use --bfq/--no-bfq as necessary if this is or is not desired.
See README.backfeed for more details.

By default, xymon sends using the existing, compatible message format used
by all previous versions (and Big Brother). To send using the "V5" format
(the size of the remaining message is prefixed, allowing truncated messages
to be rejected, and possibly future improvements later on), add the following 
to your environment:

XYMONV5SERVER=TRUE

This can be added in xymonclient.cfg, xymonserver.cfg, 
/etc/sysconfig/xymon-client or any other location where the sending 
process will have it set. This may change for the final release.

(Note: Previous trunk versions had an inverted version of this logic, requiring
XYMONV4SERVER=1 to send to an older server.)


The configure script is likely setting XYMONHOME/XYMONCLIENTHOME and
XYMSRV/XYMSERVERS/XYMONSERVERS incorrectly, which will prevent xymonlaunch
from correctly launching anything. Double check the xymon environment
files (xymonserver/xymonclient.cfg) before starting either the server or
client.

The tools/xymon-client.default and tools/xymonlaunch files may be placed
into /etc/{sysconfig,default}/{xymon-client,xymonlaunch} to more easily
set $XYMONSERVERS

Revealed by the above issue is a bug causing a crash in the client (or
anywhere) when given an empty string as the destination argument (instead
of 0, 127.0.0.1 or no variable set). Don't do this --> [ xymon '' "ping" ]

The client and logfetch binary may be being re-compiled during 'make install'

Compilation may fail if c-ares and at least one compression library is not
present (lzo/lz4/zlib are all options). xxHash libraries are also highly
recommended as the plan is for xxhash to replace md5 for checksumming
functionality. libtirpc may be necessary on some platforms, and it's
possible the build code is still expecting traditional (Sun) RPC



Using Xymon with IPv6 - Alpha Notes
===================================

IPv6 transmission of messages (client->xymond, or xymonnet->xymond) 
should be working properly.

IPv6 ICMP checks (conn tests), whether specified with literals in 
hosts.cfg or via DNS lookup, should work as expected.

Other IPv6-only TCP checks (including HTTP) are not working correctly.

IPv6 [literals] in URL checks are not parsed properly.


Currently, xymond can only listen on a single address. If your system 
supports IPv6 this will be the IPv6 interface, which means your system 
must have the IPV6_ONLY option disabled (usually in sysctl) so as to 
allow IPv4 connections to be completed over the IPv6 stack. Certain 
"localhost" connections may be seen by xymond as coming from 
"::ffff:127.0.0.1" and the IPV4-over-IPV6 addresses may be added to 
--admin-senders in tasks.cfg to do what you want.
